<p>On Sunday, November 17th, I received the <a href="../stock-purcahse-agreement.docx">Stock Purchase
Agreement</a> from our business
attorney.  Unfortunately, I was a bit tired (and unbeknownst to me
at the time, slightly sick) when I received it, so I didn't make it
immediately available.  Turns out, I had covid, which I gave to my
ninety-two year old mother and that caused a lot of problems<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-1-1"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<details>
<summary>Mom's Status (slipping into dementia)</summary>
<p>Physically, mom is completely recovered from covid as you can see by
<a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/137430788">her Strava activity</a> (or
just trust me if you don't have a Strava account). However, mentally
she took a hit that is worrisome.</p>
<p>People on the BARGE mailing list may know that my mom stuffered a
stroke on March 27th, 2024.  On April 13th, after she was released
from ICU -&gt; Hospital Room -&gt; Inpatient Rehab, she was no longer fit to
live alone. My sister lived with her until June 3rd, when I took
over. I've been there ever since, although I've been spelled by my
sister or wife here and there.</p>
<p>Mom's mental acuity and memory were slowly starting to fail
pre-stroke.  They both took a huge hit with her stroke, but she
regained <em>much of</em>—but not all—she had lost, before
I gave her covid.</p>
<p>IMO, without the stroke and without covid, mom would have been sliding
slowly into dementia.  The stroke made things worse, with a big dip
followed by a rebound. Covid was a smaller dip and so far, a smaller
rebound.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>My Status (healthy, and adjusting)</summary>
<p>I still have a great immune system and probably never would have
gotten covid had I not done a twenty-four hour race in the drinking
division (meaning I had to drink a beer before each hilly four mile
loop) on November 8th<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-2-1"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>.  FWIW, I've done that race several times
before without getting sick, but I've lost fitness since I've become
my mother's minder.</p>
<p>When both mom and I had covid at the same time, I still had to tend to
her and her ancient cat, which slowed my recovery.  I only missed a
few trainings, but I did get very tired every afternoon for a while.
Now my afternoon tiredness has returned to "normal" (normal for me),
which is dependent on how much quality sleep I got the night before.</p>
<p>Before covid, I had begun reprogramming myself to work efficiently in
the presence of a zillion tiny interruptions per-day.  During covid it
almost seemed hopeless as everything ground to a halt.  Now that we're
both through it, I'm continuing to tweak my schedule and habits to be
effective even in the absence of large blocks of uninterrupted time
(FTR, that mostly means not goofing off at the beginning of each work
block).</p>
</details>
<h2 id="title3-funds-is-a-go"><a class="header" href="#title3-funds-is-a-go">Title3 Funds is a go!</a></h2>
<p>So, even with the Stock Purchase Agreement in hand, I did not send
email to <a href="https://www.title3funds.com/">Title3 Funds</a> until I was
pretty sure that both mom and I were fully recovered (except her
increase in dementia).  I got a promising reply Friday the thirteenth
and it took a few days to schedule and have a call, but that happened
yesterday morning (Tuesday the seventeenth of December) and we're moving
forward.</p>
<p>I'd say "all steam ahead", except it's both the holidays and the end
of the year, both of which slow things down. Title3 Funds needs a few
things:</p>
<ol>
<li>reviewed financial statements</li>
<li>completion of <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/formc.pdf">SEC Form C</a><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-3-1"><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup></li>
<li>marketing materials</li>
</ol>
<p>The financial statements have to come from CPC's accountant and I don't
yet know how long that will take. I <em>think</em> it can be done without much
effort, because CPC has had no income and the accountant has already
prepared CPC's 2022 and 2023 tax returns.</p>
<p>I've already completed about 80% of the Form C, but I'll need a little
help from our business attorney (and maybe the accountant) to double check
a few things.</p>
<p>I can do the marketing materials myself.  They'll suck, but I think
they'll be good enough.  Only one way to find out.  Spoiler: it'll
largely be a rewording of what I've already said, because although I'm
literally years behind schedule, the overall plan hasn't changed.</p>
<p>While working on the above three things, I'll also continue working on
mb2, albeit mostly working on the <a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22high+priority%22+label%3Abug">bug
backlog</a>
rather than adding functionality.</p>
<p>I'm ashamed that I let so much time pass between my last status report
and this one.  I have found that if I really want to get stuff done, I
need to block out explicit time to do it and I'm especially bad at
sending status reports because I want them to be all-singing,
all-dancing and there's typically always one thing that is just about
to happen that I am willing to wait for.  My solution is to write my
status reports on Wednesdays, up at my house, after doing my
<a href="https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March/blob/master/2025.md#user-content-dec-18">Wednesday ruck speed
run</a>,
when I'm caffeinated AF.</p>
<p>Whee!</p>

<p>Covid is a complicated subject and writing a status report that
provides "the right" amount of information is not something I can do
quickly (or perhaps at all).  I'm acutely aware that "caused a lot of
problems" sounds flip if not actually callous, but I want my opening
paragraph to summarize the reason for the delay as well as to not hide
challenges. <a href="#fr-1-1">↩</a></p>
