# [BARGE](https://www.barge.org/)

Technically, BARGE stands for the Big August Rec.Gambling Excursion,
meaning it's an event.  However, it's an event that's been running
held annually since 1990 and as such, is more defined by the attendees
than the event itself.

You don't need to know anything about BARGE to use mb2, but BARGE
and BARGErs have strongly influenced mb2.  It is no coincidence that
almost all the games mb2 currently knows how to deal occur in the [BARGE
Rule Book](rule_book.html).
