# [BARGE](https://www.barge.org/)

BARGE stands for the Big August Rec.Gambling Excursion.  It's an event
that's been held annually since 1990.

You don't need to know anything about BARGE to use mb2, but BARGE and
BARGErs have strongly influenced mb2.  It is no coincidence that
almost all the games mb2 currently knows how to deal occur in the
[BARGE Rule Book](rule_book.html).
