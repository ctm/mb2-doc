# BARGE Rule Book

A hyperlinked rulebook is available at [https://www.barge.org/rulebook/](https://www.barge.org/rulebook/).
A PDF version is available at [https://www.barge.org/rulebook.pdf](https://www.barge.org/rulebook.pdf).
(The content is the same, but this version is easier to use if printed out.)

Written by BARGE's very own CMeck, the BARGE Rule Book was updated
annually through 2021 to contain all the games to be played in the BARGE
tournaments, with games from previous years moved to a different
section of the rule book.

In 2024, the rulebook was moved back to the web, and in 2025, it was
moved back to barge.org.  All the games are just alphabetized now,
because the current rulebook maintainer is lazy.
