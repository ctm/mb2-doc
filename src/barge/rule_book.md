# BARGE Rule Book

Written by BARGE's very own CMeck, the BARGE Rule Book was updated
annually through 2021 to contain all the games to be played in the BARGE
tournaments, with games from previous years moved to a different
section of the rule book.

In 2023, the BARGE Rule Book was taken down. Although the 2021 version
of the rule book can still be found on archive.org, mb2 does not link
to it there out of respect for the author. 

As a stop-gap, the rules menu items link to this page. In the future,
there will be replacement rules.  In the meantime, if you need to know
the rules, ask in the lobby.  Most games can be (poorly!) summarized
in a sentence or two.
