# BARGE Rule Book

Written by BARGE's very own Christopher J. Mecklin, the BARGE Rule
Book is updated annually to contain all the games to be played in the
BARGE tournaments, with games from previous years moved to a different
section of the rule book.

The 2021 version of the rule book is available at [https://www.ceemeck.org/BARGERuleBook2021/](https://www.ceemeck.org/BARGERuleBook2021/)
