# BARGE Rule Book

Written by BARGE's very own CMeck, the BARGE Rule Book was updated
annually through 2021 to contain all the games to be played in the BARGE
tournaments, with games from previous years moved to a different
section of the rule book.

In 2023, the interactive BARGE Rule Book was taken down and replaced
with a PDF. Although the 2021 version of the interactive rule book can
still be found on archive.org, mb2 links to the PDF version since that's
the one at barge.org.
