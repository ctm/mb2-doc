# BARGE Unified Tournament Payouts

Currently all tournaments with a buy-in pay out via the [BARGE Unified
Payout Schedule](./Unified_BARGE_payouts.pdf)[^1].

During play-testing, _most_ tournaments have an [FM](../fun_money.html) 100 buy-in and have twenty-four or fewer players.

|# Players|Percentage Payout|
|-|-|
|2-4|100%|
|5-8|65%, 35%|
|9-15|50%, 30%, 20%|
|16-24|42%, 26%, 18%, 14%|

### Examples

* An FM 100 four player tournament without bounties pays first place FM 400.

* An FM 100 four player tournament with an FM 25 bounty pays First place FM 325.
Also three FM 25 bounties are awarded.

* An eight player FM 100 tournament without bounties pays first place 520 FM
and second place FM 280.

* An eight player FM 100 tournament with an FM 25 bounty pays First place FM 406
and second place FM 219.  Also seven FM 25 bounties are awarded.

[^1]: In 2024 the BARGE Unified Payout Schedule was updated, but
somehow the one that is on the site as of January 25th, 2026 is the
old payout table.  The current payout table can be [found in the
EMBARGO 2026 structure
sheets](https://omaholic.com/2026_EMBARGO_Structures.pdf#page=7).  The
current payout table for a five to eight entrant tournament pays only
65% for first and 35% for second.
