# New to Poker?

If you're new to poker, mb2 is probably not for you at this time. In addition
to the interface being way too primitive, the current mb2 user base is a group
of people who already have quite a lot of online poker experience but choose
to play on mb2 for reasons that probably don't apply to you.  Most of the
current participants know each other or want to help test the software or
like the fact that mb2 deals a lot of esoteric games.

The current industry leader is PokerStars and they have a [nice
page](https://www.pokerstars.bet/poker/games/) you can view without
registering.  An up and coming challenger to PokerStars is GGPoker and
they have a [Poker
School](https://en.ggpoker.com/get-started/poker-school/) that
requires registration. PokerStars also has a
[school](https://www.pokerstarsschool.com/).

From mb2's developer's point of view, poker can&mdash;and
should&mdash;be fun, but poker can also be addicting. We're pro-fun
and anti-addiction (but non-judgmental). Nothing about mb2 is designed
to encourage you to play too much poker, much less get addicted.

If you're a stubborn sort and want to play on mb2 anyway, great! Welcome
aboard. [One of us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39Bnk6VU53Y)!
