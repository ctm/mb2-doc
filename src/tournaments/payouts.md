# Payouts

Currently all tournaments with a buy-in pay out via the [BARGE Unified
Payout Schedule](../barge/payouts.html).  The size of the payout pool
is the sum of all of the buy-ins minus any amount reserved for bounties.
Currently, in rebuy and/or add-on tournaments, none of the rebuy or add-on
buy-in goes into the prize pool.
