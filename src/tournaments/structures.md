# Structures

How a tournament is played is defined by the tournament's structure. Structures
contain information like
* how many chips a player starts with
* how many lammers, if any, a player starts with
* the levels
* the breaks
* how many seats per table

Each level includes information like
* which game(s) are played at that level
* the stakes for the games

### Limitations

Some of the information for a structure is available from the list of
tournaments available in the lobby. Some of the other information is
hidden, solely because nobody has written a nice UI to reveal that
information.

You can not currently define your own structures, but mb2 has well over
a hundred structures "baked in."

### Examples
You can see example structure sheets in the [*ARGE Structures](../barge/structures.html) section of
this manual.
