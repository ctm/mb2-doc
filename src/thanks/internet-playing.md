# Playing Poker on the internet

## IRC poker

### Todd Mummert and Greg Reynolds

Todd wrote the bot that [dealt poker on an IRC
server](https://www.pokerlistings.com/blog/the-first-online-poker-room-irc-poker)
at CMU.  IRC poker was social, but many people honed their game by
taking it semi-seriously.

IRC was text-only, but Greg was able to build a Graphical User Interface
on top of it (although I used only the text interface).
