## BARGE

In 1994, I attended my first [BARGE](https://www.barge.org/). The organizers
did an excellent job putting the event together and my fellow BARGErs were
welcoming, fun, interesting and knowledgeable.

### Organizers Emeritus Michael Zimmers and Chuck Weinstock

Michael attended his first BARGE in 1992 when it was still
semi-spontaneous.  Chuck's first was 1993.

Since 1994 was my first BARGE, and since BARGE would come to be a
minor influence on multibot and a huge influence on mb2, these two
organizers get explicit thanks here.  Michael and Chuck have also
been playing on mb2 since the early days and are two of the most
frequent players.
