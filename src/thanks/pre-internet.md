## Intro to Las Vegas and Video Poker

### my sister Marcia

My older sister Marcia took me to see the [Grateful Dead on January
15th, 1979](https://archive.org/details/gd1979-01-15.all.aud-rolfe.127556.flac1644).

### the Grateful Dead

During my college years I had the time, money and inclination to go
see the Grateful Dead play in many different venues. Some of their
songs (e.g. [Deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhaBtdN_GQk) and
[Loser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWIIQ-FO8ic)) involve
gambling, both metaphorically and actually playing poker.


On March 26th, 1983 the Grateful Dead [played Las
Vegas](https://archive.org/details/gd1983-03-26.140315.sbd.eaton.miller.clugston.flac1648).
I drove out to see them.  I had a great time and wound up fascinated
by the video poker machine in the Best Western.  So, once I got back to
Albuquerque, I wrote my own video poker software.
