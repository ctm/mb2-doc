# Multibot

Todd's server did not (initially?) deal tournaments, but, if I
remember correctly, some of us chose to create the tournament
experience by starting at a table and raising the blinds as we played.
There were many drawbacks to these (up to 23-players for Hold'em)
tounaments.

On Halloween 1998, I wrote the core of "multibot", an IRC bot to deal
multi-table tournaments.  I did it on Halloweeen because I knew that the
constant interruption from trick-or-treaters would preclude me from doing
Macintosh emulation work that required serious concentration.

Although multibot's core was initially in C, I soon rewrote multibot
in Objective-C, a language that I had to use to port
[Executor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executor_(software)) to
NeXTSTEP.  I wound up liking Objective-C and used multibot as a
vehicle to help me learn it better.


## I needed money

I had planned on making multibot open source, but I had a loan that I
I needed to pay back.

## They needed Poker Software

#### The Napolitanos

So, I wound up selling multibot to the Napolitanos where it became the server
for Poker School Online.

## Multibot needed a graphical client and support

### Mike Wing

My friend Mike Wing wrote the core of the Java client for multibot.

### Gavin Scott

Gavin maintained and extended multibot at Poker School Online.
