# Ancient Programming and Computer Games

## Christopher Caldwell

Chris was my best friend in seventh grade and high school.  He learned
to program before I did and I learned a lot from him. He created some
amazing multi-player games on the UNH Dec-10.

## Rick Daley

I met Rick at UNH and we hit it off well. After I got my MSCS from
UNM, Chris, Rick and I briefly tried to put together a company that
was going to create online games.
