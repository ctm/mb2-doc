# Post-multibot

I had no intention of returning to the poker software business.  I
certainly didn't want to compete with the Napolitanos and I had
several other opportunities to pursue.  However&hellip;

## My name was out there

### Loic Dachary

I was quite honored to be invited to a meeting of people writing poker
software in JavaScript. Loic was working for OutFlop and I was amazed
by what they could do with JavaScript and impressed that they were
building Open Source.

## Serious Time Sinks

### Anonymous (at least for now) MMO developer

A friend of mine was a lead developer on an MMO.  At one point he
mentioned that on at least one occasion when people found out he had
worked on that MMO, he was verbally attacked. That MMO was
sufficiently addicting that they felt they had lost far too much
their life and somehow he was to blame.

### Anonymous (at least for now) MMO players

A couple other friends of mine got very active in an MMO and&hellip;
eventually decided that they had wasted months, if not years, of their
time due to the addictiveness of this game.

## Rust is an awesome language

I read a lot of good things about Rust and eventually I started
dabbling in it.  Eventually I started thinking about writing another
poker server.  By then Poker School Online had been bought by Poker
Stars and my software had been completely decommissioned, so I wouldn't
be competing with the people who bought multibot.

The more I played with Rust the more I wanted to learn (although to be
fair, there were days when Rust's steep learning curve was pretty
intimidating).

## My daughters liked to play poker

My wife and I used a bunch of the money I got from Poker School Online
to go through five rounds of in-vitro conception, resulting in three
children.  As they grew, I spent a little time playing an MMO with my
eldest: my son Elvis. For some reason my daughters enjoyed (at least
briefly) playing poker with me with real cards and cheap chips.

### Margaret and Iris

So, being terminally lazy&mdash;and wanting to learn Rust&mdash;I decided
to write software to deal poker rather than having to get out, play with
and put away actual cards and chips.
