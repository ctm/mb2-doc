# Thanks!

Here's an incomplete, semi-chronoligical list of people (and one band)
who have, in some way contributed to the birth of mb2.  I'm sure there
are very important people whom I've left out.  I'll add them as I
think of them.  If you're one of them, let me know.

I am not attempting to thank everyone who has helped my life in
general.  I've been blessed by having great parents, friends,
teachers, professors, clients and doctors, all of whom have allowed me
to live a charmed life. However, the people mentioned here _directly_
contributed to my creating mb2.
