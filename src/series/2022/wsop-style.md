# WSOP-Style 2022

## Overview

The WSOP-Style 2022 Series consisted of a tournament a day from
Saturday, June 11th through Sunday, July 3rd, 2022.  Each tournament started
at 3pm Pacific time (6pm Eastern).

There was [no late
entry](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues/183). Additionally,
instead of re-entries, the tournaments used rebuys.  The difference
being that rebuys happen immediately after you bust and you retain the
seat that you were busted in.  So, when the structure sheet said the
tournament supported two re-entries through level 15, you were
allowed (but not required) to rebuy up to twice, but only through
level 15.

This series was open to the public.

## Prize for first place

Craft Poker Co. sent a physical prize to the winner of each
tournament in the series[^1]. The prize will be an [Engraved Rectangular
Glass
Paperweight](https://www.trophies2go.com/engraved-rettangolo-glass-paperweight.html)
unless they run out or other unforeseen circumstances.

There will _probably_ also be nicer prizes for the top three
leaderboard at the end of the series, but nothing has been finalized yet.

## Leaderboard

Mb2 knows which tournaments belonged to this series and there is a
"WSOPS Leaderboard" available from the lobby.

The leaderboard tracked [Fun Money](../fun_money.md).  Each of the tournaments
had an FM 200 buy-in and Fun Money is awarded using the [BARGE Unified Payout
Schedule](../barge/payouts.md). All rebuys were for FM 200 each and all of
the Fun Money from rebuys goes directly into the prize pool,

The top three profitable players were:

|RANK|PROFIT|NICK|
|----|------|----|
|1st|1520|royalflush|
|2nd|1470|deadhead|
|3rd|760|ADBDaVoice üé§|
