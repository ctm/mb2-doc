# 2024

On February 1st, 2nd and 3rd, craftpoker.com hosted [WYWAE](2024/wywae.md).

In parallel with the World Series of Poker, Craftpoker.com had hoped
to host the [WSOP-Style](2024/wsop-style.md) series as it had the two
prior years. Unfortunately, it had to be scuttled, due to a lack of funds.

July 15th through July 20th **may** bring the return of
[WYWAB](2024/wywab.md) (Wish You Were at
[BARGE](https://www.barge.org)).
