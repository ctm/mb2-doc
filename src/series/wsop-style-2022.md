# WSOP-Style 2022

## Overview

The WSOP-Style 2022 Series consists of a tournament a day from
Saturday, June 11th through Sunday, June 3rd, 2002.  Each tournament starts
at 3pm Pacific time (6pm Eastern).

There is [no late
entry](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues/183). Additionally,
instead of re-entries, the tournaments uses rebuys.  The difference
being that rebuys happen immediately after you bust and you retain the
seat that you were busted in.  So, if the structure sheet says the
tournament supports two re-entries through level 15, you will be
allowed (but not required) to rebuy up to twice, but only through
level 15.

This series is open to the public.  Tell others.  Although there's
still a lot of room for improvement, the user interface should be
usable by anyone who already has some online or cardroom poker
experience .

## Tournament Length

Each of the WSOPS tournaments starts with the same five minute round
duration parameter that is used for mb2's evening and night
tournament.  With a dozen players the evening and night tournaments
have typically finished in an hour and a half.

If we get enough players, I'll [add the ability to put a soft two-hour
limit](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues/969) on the tournaments.
It will work by looking at the number of players that are signed up when
the tournament starts, estimating how long it will take to finish with
five minute rounds and if that estimate is over two hours, it makes
the rounds shorter so that the estimate is two hours.  As such, even
if this series grows larger than the evening and nightly tournaments,
the overall tournament duration for the winner shouldn't ever be much
more than two hours.

## Prize for first place

Craft Poker Co. will provide a physical prize to the winner of each
tournament in the series. The prize will be an [Engraved Rectangular
Glass
Paperweight](https://www.trophies2go.com/engraved-rettangolo-glass-paperweight.html)
unless they run out or other unforeseen circumstances.

There will _probably_ also be nicer prizes for the top three
leaderboard at the end of the series, but nothing has been finalized yet.

## Leaderboard

Mb2 knows which tournaments belong to this series and there is a
"WSOPS Leaderboard" available from the lobby.

The leaderboard tracks [Fun Money](../fun_money.md).  Each of the tournaments
has an FM 200 buy-in and Fun Money is awarded using the [BARGE Unified Payout
Schedule](../barge/payouts.md). All rebuys are for FM 200 each and all of
the Fun Money from rebuys goes directly into the prize pool,

## Synchronized Breaks

Each tournament is run with synchronized breaks, meaning when the time
of day is fifty-five minutes past the hour, at the end of the hand
each table will pause. Once all tables are paused, there will be a
five minute break after which all the tables will resume
simultaneously.
