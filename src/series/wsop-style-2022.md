# WSOP-Style 2022

The WSOP-Style 2022 Series consists of a tournament a day from
Saturday, June 11th through Sunday, June 3rd, 2002.

Not only is this series open to the public, I'm hoping to get interest
from non-BARGE players.  If you know someone who might be interested,
tell them about mb2, devctm.com, this series and this page.

## More details, coming soon

I'll be updating this page after I post a brief announcement of the series
on the BARGE list.
