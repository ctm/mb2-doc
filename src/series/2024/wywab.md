# WYWAB

## Overview

WYWAB stands for "Wish You Were At
[BARGE](https://www.barge.org/barge-2024-schedule)".  

WYWAB is an annual series of craftpoker.com tournaments where each
tournament uses the same structures (and typically same starting
times) as most of the tournaments that are spread at BARGE.

WYWAB tournaments are open to all and are free.


## No prizes or awards, just Fun Money
Unlike previous years, in 2024, there are No prizes, or
cash awards, just [Fun Money](../../fun_money.md).

## The Tournaments

All times on this page are in the Pacific Daylight Saving Time time
zone.  In the craftpoker.com lobby, all times are in the time zone
your is browser configured for (probably your local time zone).  So,
if you're not going to play in the Pacific DST time zone, you'll need
to either convert from Pacific or use the lobby to figure out when
each tournament starts.

Each tournament row in the following table contains two links.
The start time is a link to the BARGE Structure Sheet and the
event is a link to the Mb2 Structure Sheet.

## Some Differences

Mb2, the software used to run the tournaments is very flexible, but
it doesn't (yet?) know how to deal a Funbook tournament, nor does
it support CHORSE or Chinese Poker.  As such, those three tournaments
are not part of WYWAB 2024.  Similarly, mb2 doesn't deal shoot-outs,
so the Triple Stud tournament is a Freezeout.

For the tournaments that are dealt, some differences are just to
improve the online experience and keep the tournaments from taking too
long:

* Except for Five Card PLO and the Tournament of Champions style tournament, rounds
last five minutes.  Five Card PLO rounds are six minutes and fifteen seconds.
Tournament of Champions style tournament
has five minute Hold'em rounds, six minute Stud rounds
and seven minute twenty seconds Omaha/8 rounds.

* There are no chip races.

* Breaks start "on the 55", which means that once each table has finished
a hand after fifty-five minutes after the hour, all tables will get a five
minute break.

These differences, however, are due to a lack of planning:

* In each tournament with a big blind ante, the antes are posted
_before_ the big blind.  That meant that if you only have a fraction of
the big blind after paying the ante, you are only able to win the
ante plus the amount of chips you got when you multiplied that
fraction of the big blind by the number of players who had also put in
that much or more.

* Final tables of mixed game tournaments do not restart the mix at the
beginning. So, for example, although the HOT tournament
starts with Hold'em, the final table will continue dealing whatever it is
dealing before the other table is merged into it.

* Currently, rebuy and add-on support in mb2 is pretty weak.
Specifically, add-ons cost the same amount as the entry, so for the
"NLHE & PLO Double Board Bomb Pot (w/ rebuys)" tournament, the buy-in
is FM 60 so that the rebuys will also be FM 60.  Additionally,
all the rebuy FM goes into the prize pool (mb2 does not yet implement
vig or charity diversions).

* Mb2 always allows a double-bet on fourth street in Seven Card Stud
when a pair is showing. BARGE tournaments do no allow this.

* Mb2 will continue to use the [old BARGE Unified Payout
Structure](https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/7fa840da/files/uploaded/Unified_BARGE_payouts.pdf).

* Mb2 does not yet know how to change the number of seats for the final
table, so all final tables will have the number of seats as the tournament
starts with.  So, "NLHE & PLO Double Board Bomb Pot (w/ rebuys)" will have
an eight handed final table, whereas at BARGE it will be nine handed.
HOT's final table will be six, not seven. TOC-Style will have an eight
handed final table, as opposed to nine.
