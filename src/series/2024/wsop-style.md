# WSOP-Style 2024

## No Prizes, No Cash, Just Fun

With the exception of the May 28th and July 5th events, there were
no prizes.  The May 28th tournament had six players, so two places paid:
jrx won $100 for finishing first and smalltalkdan won $45 for coming in
second.  The July 5th event had sixteen players[^1], so four places paid:
smalltalkdan won $100, tegwin won $65 in second place, jpmassar $45 in
third and JADCüö¥ received $35 for fourth.

## Overview

The WSOP-Style Series is a set of free tournaments
one per day, from May 28th through July 17th. Those are the days
the World Series of Poker are being held in Las Vegas, Nevada and the World
Series of Poker prov6ides the inspiration for this series.

**This series is not even remotely affiliated with the World Series of Poker.**

This series does, however, use modified versions of the World Series
of Poker tournament structures for each of the daily tournaments, with
the exception of July 5th ([see below](#july-5th)).  All of the craftpoker.com
WSOP-Style tournaments are played in one day, with five minute breaks
every hour. Each starts at 5:05 pm Pacific time (8:05 pm Eastern).

Late registration varies per tournament, but is always available for at least
thirty-five minutes after the tournament starts. 

Many tournaments allow one or more re-entries.

### All are welcome

All events in this series are open to the public.

### No Early Start on Weekend

Unlike 2022 and 2023, when the weekend tournaments started two hours
earlier than the weekday tournaments, all WSOP-Style Series
tournaments **in 2024** start at the same time (5:05 pm Pacific).

### Round Duration

All levels will be five minutes long.

There will be a five minute break that will start after each table has
completed a hand at 55 minutes past the hour or later. That means the
last table to finish a hand at 55 minutes past the hour or later will
get exactly a five minute breaks and all other tables will be paused
while waiting for that table to finish a hand.

### Leaderboard

There is a "WSOPS 2024 Leaderboard" entry in the Leaderboard menu
available in the lobby.  By default, only players with a net [Fun
Money](../../fun_money.md) win show up on leaderboards, but if you've played
and have a net loss, you can see your entry by having the shift key
held down when you select an entry from the Leaderboard menu.

### July 5th

Since July 5th has no World Series of Poker tournament play, July 5th
is a [BARGE](https://www.barge.org/) inspired structure, "SAM_6", a four game mix of:
* [**S**crotum](https://secure.barge.org/bargerulebooks/BARGERuleBook2021-20210712.pdf#page=59)
* [**A**ction Razz](https://secure.barge.org/bargerulebooks/BARGERuleBook2021-20210712.pdf#page=30)
* [**M**urder](https://secure.barge.org/bargerulebooks/BARGERuleBook2021-20210712.pdf#page=56)
* [**6**-card Sohe](https://secure.barge.org/bargerulebooks/BARGERuleBook2021-20210712.pdf#page=24)

"Sam_6" was the nickname of [David
Lawful](https://feldmanmortuary.com/tribute/details/4734/David-Lawful/obituary.html),
a generous member of BARGE.  He liked to play odd games, although he was a
formidable opponent in all and a BARGE main event winner (2013).

[^1]: One player entered twice, using separate nicknames.  His second entry
took second place, but by mutual agreement we decided to not include his
second entry in the prize money.  I will make that explicit in future
series.
