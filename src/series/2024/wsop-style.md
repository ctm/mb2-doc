# WSOP-Style 2024

## Canceled

On behalf of Craft Poker Co. (CPC), I have canceled all but two of the
WSOP-Style Series for 2024 events.

The Series was to have started on Tuesday, May 28th and run through
July 17th. Instead, the only two WSOP-Style events that craftpoker.com
will be run in 2024 are:

1. May 28th "[#2 Casino Employees No-Limit Hold'em](https://www.wsop.com/pdfs/structuresheets/structure_5504_23142.pdf)" (you do
_not_ need to be a casino employee to play in this tournament; just
think good thoughts about them)

2. [July 5th SAM_6 tournament](http://127.0.0.1:3000/series/2024/wsop-style.html#july-5th).

### Explanation

I started work on the series at the beginning of March and by March
10th, I had the initial implementation of Double Board Bomb Pot
Hold'em and Omaha running nicely. Unfortunately, other complicating
surprises occurred in March, including some trouble with the New
Mexico Taxation and Revenue department and my mother having a stroke
on March 27th.

Considering what happened, my mother is doing well.  She turned
ninety-two on May 16th.  She can no longer live alone, but my sister
has moved in with her.

I have not, however, come to an agreement with NM T&R yet, and not
only has our back and forth cost me time, it's also cost me a lot of
sleep, which meant I wasn't feeling up to dealing with humans
much.  I'm incredibly self-conscious interacting with people when I'm
tired; my productivity as a programmer decrease too, but if I do
stupid programming things, the computer doesn't hold it against me.

### Last Minute Notice

I apologize for announcing this so close to what would have been the
start of the series.

As recently as Tuesday, May 21st, I was optimistic that I could "run
ahead" of the events and line up money for awards in the nick of time,
but I underestimated many things.  Furthermore, I hadn't publicized
the series, except on the BARGE list (I hadn't even posted to
BARGE-announce), so it wasn't like adding money would bring new players
to the site.

I do very much like to give back to the communities that I participate
in.  Additionally, I had looked forward to the WSOP-Style Series 2024,
since the end of last year's. However, it's best for CPC and for the
users of MB2 for me to not offer the WSOP-Style series this year, and
instead to get CPC back on track.

With luck, we'll be able to hold WYWAB (Wish You Were at BARGE).

## Overview

In 2024, there is no WSOP-Style Series, per-se. Instead, there will be
two free tournaments with a cash prize, one on Tuesday, May 28th
and the other on Friday, July 5th.

**These tournaments are not even remotely affiliated with the World Series of Poker.**

There will be no option to receive a physical prize, only cash via
Venmo or Zelle.  Up to five places will pay per tournament, dependent
on the number of players.

### All are welcome

Both events are open to the public.

### Payouts

The amount CPC will pay will depend on how many players[^12]
participate:

|Place| 2-4| 5-8|9-15|16-24|25 or more|
|----:|---:|---:|---:|----:|---------:|
|  1st|$100|$100|$100| $100|      $100|
|  2nd|    | $45| $60|  $60|       $65|
|  3rd|    |    | $40|  $45|       $50|
|  4th|    |    |    |  $35|       $35|
|  5th|    |    |    |     |       $30|


## Re-entries don't count as separate players

Re-entries are not included in the player count, because the player
who re-enters is already counted.  That means it is possible for
players to win Fun Money but not actually win real cash, because the
Fun Money payouts _do_ count re-entries.

More details will be available as the series approaches.  With luck,
everything will be finalized no later than May 10th.

### Overall prizes

Since there are only two WSOP-Style tournaments this year, there _will **not**_
be prizes for the best overall players.

### Round Duration

All levels will be five minutes long.

There will be a five minute break that will start after each table has
completed a hand at 55 minutes past the hour or later. That means the
last table to finish a hand at 55 minutes past the hour or later will
get exactly a five minute breaks and all other tables will be paused
while waiting for that table to finish a hand.

### July 5th

Since July 5th has no World Series of Poker tournament play, July 5th
is a [BARGE](https://www.barge.org/) inspired structure, "[SAM_6](https://craftpoker.com/tournament/template/wsop-2023-75x-sam-6-championship)", a four game mix of:
* [**S**crotum](https://secure.barge.org/bargerulebooks/BARGERuleBook2021-20210712.pdf#page=59)
* [**A**ction Razz](https://secure.barge.org/bargerulebooks/BARGERuleBook2021-20210712.pdf#page=30)
* [**M**urder](https://secure.barge.org/bargerulebooks/BARGERuleBook2021-20210712.pdf#page=56)
* [**6**-card Sohe](https://secure.barge.org/bargerulebooks/BARGERuleBook2021-20210712.pdf#page=24)

"Sam_6" was the nickname of [David
Lawful](https://feldmanmortuary.com/tribute/details/4734/David-Lawful/obituary.html),
a generous member of BARGE.  He liked to play odd games, although he was a
formidable opponent in all. He won the BARGE main event in 2013.
