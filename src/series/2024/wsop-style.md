# WSOP-Style 2024

## Overview

The WSOP-Style Series is a set of free tournaments with a cash prize,
one per day, from May 28th through July 17th. Those are the days
the World Series of Poker are being held in Las Vegas, Nevada and the World
Series of Poker provides the inspiration for this series.

**This series is not even remotely affiliated with the World Series of Poker.**

This series does, however, use modified versions of the World Series
of Poker tournament structures for each of the daily tournaments, with
the exception of July 5th (see below).  All of the craftpoker.com
WSOP-Style tournaments are played in one day, with five minute breaks
every hour. Each starts at:

* Monday through Friday: 5pm Pacific time (8pm Eastern)
* Saturday and Sunday: 3pm Pacific time (6pm Eastern)

WSOP-Style 2024 will be fairly similar to [WSOP-Style
2023](../2023/wsop-style.md), although there will be no option to
receive a physical prize, only cash via Venmo or Zelle.  Additionally,
up to five places will pay per tournament, dependent on the number of
players.

### All are welcome

All events in this series are open to the public. Please spread the word.


### Payouts

Payments, depending on how many players[^12] participate:

|Place| 2-4| 5-8|9-15|16-24|25 or more|
|----:|---:|---:|---:|----:|---------:|
|  1st|$100|$100|$100| $100|      $100|
|  2nd|    | $45| $60|  $60|       $65|
|  3rd|    |    | $40|  $45|       $50|
|  4th|    |    |    |  $35|       $35|
|  5th|    |    |    |     |       $30|


### Overall prizes

There _may_ be overall prizes for the top three players on the
WSOP-Style 2024 leaderboard by Net Profit and by Win Rate.  If so, to
qualify for a win rate prize, the player will have to complete at
least seven tournaments.



## Re-entries don't count as separate players

Re-entries are not included in the player count, because the player
who re-enters is already counted.  That means it is possible for
players to win Fun Money but not actually win real cash, because the
Fun Money payouts _do_ count re-entries.

More details will be available as the series approaches.  With luck,
everything will be finalized no later than May 10th.

## The Tournaments

Each day, other than July 5th (see below), has a tournament whose
rounds are derived from a structure that is being played in Las Vegas
on that day.

All of the WSOP-Style 2024 tournaments are currently available on
craftpoker.com.  Most can be found with the `"WSOP 2024"-style` prefix,
the exceptions are noted with footnotes.

### July 5th

Since July 5th has no World Series of Poker tournament play, July 5th
is a [BARGE](https://www.barge.org/) inspired structure, "SAM_6", a four game mix of:
* [**S**crotum](https://secure.barge.org/bargerulebooks/BARGERuleBook2021-20210712.pdf#page=59)
* [**A**ction Razz](https://secure.barge.org/bargerulebooks/BARGERuleBook2021-20210712.pdf#page=30)
* [**M**urder](https://secure.barge.org/bargerulebooks/BARGERuleBook2021-20210712.pdf#page=56)
* [**6**-card Sohe](https://secure.barge.org/bargerulebooks/BARGERuleBook2021-20210712.pdf#page=24)

"Sam_6" was the nickname of [David
Lawful](https://feldmanmortuary.com/tribute/details/4734/David-Lawful/obituary.html),
a generous member of BARGE.  He liked to play odd games, although he was a
formidable opponent in all and a BARGE main event winner (2013).
