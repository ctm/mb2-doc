# WSOP-Style

## Overview

WSOP-Style 2024 will be fairly similar to [WSOP-Style
2023](../2023/wsop-style.md), although there will be no option to
receive a physical prize, only cash via Venmo or Zelle.  Additionally,
up to five places will pay, depending on the number of players we get.

Payments, depending on how many players[^12] participate:

|Place| 2-4| 5-8|9-15|16-24|25 or more|
|----:|---:|---:|---:|----:|---------:|
|  1st|$100|$100|$100| $100|      $100|
|  2nd|    | $45| $60|  $60|       $65|
|  3rd|    |    | $40|  $45|       $50|
|  4th|    |    |    |  $35|       $35|
|  5th|    |    |    |     |       $30|


## Re-entries don't count as separate players

Re-entries are not included in the player count, because the player
who re-enters is already counted.  That means it is possible for
players to win Fun Money but not actually win real cash, because the
Fun Money payouts _do_ count re-entries.

More details will be available as the series approaches.  With luck,
everything will be finalized no later than May 10th.

### All are welcome

All events in this series are open to the public. Spread the word.


## The Tournaments

The tournament for July 5th has not yet been chosen.  The others have,
and are now available on mb2 at
[craftpoker.com](https://craftpoker.com).  However, eleven of the
fifty structures for WSOPS 2024 are the exact same as we used in
WSOPS 2023.  In the following table, each structure that is being
reused is identified by a footnote.
