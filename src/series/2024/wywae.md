# WYWAE

## Overview

WYWAE stands for "Wish You Were At
[EMBARGO](https://www.barge.org/schedule1)".  

The WYWAE 2024 series was an
mb2 tournament dealt for each of the EMBARGO tournaments.

Each tournament was a freeroll: there was no fee to enter and entry was
available to the public.

The winner of each tournament received $100 via Venmo or Zelle.

Additional places paid, depending on how many players participated[^1]:

|Place| 2-4| 5-8|9-15|16-24|25 or more|
|----:|---:|---:|---:|----:|---------:|
|  1st|$100|$100|$100| $100|      $100|
|  2nd|    | $45| $60|  $60|       $65|
|  3rd|    |    | $40|  $45|       $50|
|  4th|    |    |    |  $35|       $35|
|  5th|    |    |    |     |       $30|

## Re-entries didn't count as separate players

Re-entries weren't included in the player count, because the player who
re-entered had already been counted.  That means it had been
possible for players to win Fun Money but not actually win real cash,
because the Fun Money payouts _do_ count re-entries.


## The Tournaments

All five tournaments were held in February. The first was on
Thursday the 1st, then the following two days each had two
tournaments.

The times listed in this table are all in Pacific Standard, since
that's the time zone of Las Vegas.

Each of the events in the table below is a link to the
appropriate page of the EMBARGO 2024 Structure
Sheet.

Although the EMBARGO Structure Sheet was used as a reference, this
series was not sanctioned, endorsed or in any other way sponsored or
related to the BARGE organization.  It was put on by Craft Poker Co.,
a completely unrelated corporation.

## A few Differences from EMBARGO

Since this is an online event, we've made a few changes.

### Round Duration

All rounds were five minutes long, except in the Tournament of Champions, where each round was one
third the duration of what was played at EMBARGO:

|Round|Minutes:Seconds|
|-----|--------|
|Limit Hold'em|5:00|
|Stud|6:00|
|Omaha|7:20|
|No-Limit Hold'em|6:40|

### Breaks at 55 past the hour

The WYWAE breaks began after each table had finished a hand at or
after 55 minutes after the hour. The break was then five minutes
long.

### Late Registration

In the WYWAE tournaments, late registration was allowed through level 9.

### Re-entries

During WYWAE tournaments, players were able to re-enter up to two times,
through level 9.

## It wasn't EMBARGO, but it was fun

In addition to it being fun, bugs were found and edge cases
were explored. Thank you, all players. Your participation has improved
mb2.

[^2]: There was no cash value associated with the bounties, per-se, only [Fun Money](../../fun_money.md), but the cash payouts were ranked by Fun Money won, which did include the bounties.
