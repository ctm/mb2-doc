# WYWAE

## Overview

WYWAE stands for "Wish You Were At
[EMBARGO](https://www.barge.org/schedule1)".  

The WYWAE series is an
mb2 tournament dealt for each of the EMBARGO tournaments.

Each tournament is a freeroll: there is no fee to enter and entry is
available to the public.

The winner of each tournament will receive $100 via Venmo or Zelle.

Other places will pay, depending on how many players enter[^1]:


|Place| 2-4| 5-8|9-15|16-24|25 or more|
|----:|---:|---:|---:|----:|---------:|
|  1st|$100|$100|$100| $100|      $100|
|  2nd|    | $45| $60|  $60|       $65|
|  3rd|    |    | $40|  $45|       $50|

## The Tournaments

All five tournaments will be held in February. The first will be on
Thursday the 1st, then the following two days will each have two
tournaments.

The times listed in this table are all in Pacific Standard, since
that's the time zone of Las Vegas.

In the mb2 lobby, the times will be in the time zone your
browser is configured for (which&mdash;for most people&mdash;is your
local time zone).

Each of the events in the table below will eventually be a link to the
appropriate page of the EMBARGO 2024 Structure
Sheet.

Although the EMBARGO Structure Sheet will be used as a reference, this
series is not sanctioned, endorsed or in any other way sponsored or
related to the BARGE organization.  It is being put on by Craft Poker Co.,
a completely unrelated corporation.
