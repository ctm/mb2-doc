# WYWAE

## Overview

WYWAE stands for "Wish You Were At
[EMBARGO](https://www.barge.org/schedule1)".  

The WYWAE series is an
mb2 tournament dealt for each of the EMBARGO tournaments.

Each tournament is a freeroll: there is no fee to enter and entry is
available to the public.

The winner of each tournament will receive $100 via Venmo or Zelle.

Other places will pay, depending on how many players participate[^1]:

|Place| 2-4| 5-8|9-15|16-24|25 or more|
|----:|---:|---:|---:|----:|---------:|
|  1st|$100|$100|$100| $100|      $100|
|  2nd|    | $45| $60|  $60|       $65|
|  3rd|    |    | $40|  $45|       $50|
|  4th|    |    |    |  $35|       $35|
|  5th|    |    |    |     |       $30|

## Re-entries don't count as separate players

Re-entries aren't included in the player count, because the player who
is re-entering has already been counted.  That means it may be
possible for you to win Fun Money but not actually win real cash,
because the Fun Money payouts _do_ count re-entries. I apologize for
this discrepancy. When I first set up WYWAE I didn't anticipate
the complications re-entries would add.


## The Tournaments

All five tournaments will be held in February. The first will be on
Thursday the 1st, then the following two days will each have two
tournaments.

The times listed in this table are all in Pacific Standard, since
that's the time zone of Las Vegas.

In the mb2 lobby, the times will be in the time zone your
browser is configured for (which&mdash;for most people&mdash;is your
local time zone).

Each of the events in the table below is a link to the
appropriate page of the EMBARGO 2024 Structure
Sheet.

Although the EMBARGO Structure Sheet will be used as a reference, this
series is not sanctioned, endorsed or in any other way sponsored or
related to the BARGE organization.  It is being put on by Craft Poker Co.,
a completely unrelated corporation.

## A few Differences from EMBARGO

Since this is an online event, we've made a few changes.

### Round Duration

All rounds are five minutes long, except in the Tournament of Champions, where each round is one
third the duration of what is being played at EMBARGO:

|Round|Minutes:Seconds|
|-----|--------|
|Limit Hold'em|5:00|
|Stud|6:00|
|Omaha|7:20|
|No-Limit Hold'em|6:40|

### Breaks at 55 past the hour

The WYWAE breaks will begin after each table has finished a hand at or after 55 minutes
after the hour. The break will then be five minutes long.

### Late Registration

In the WYWAE tournaments, late registration will be allowed through level 9.

### Re-entries

During WYWAE tournaments, you may re-enter up to two times, through level 9.

[^1]: Real players; no sock puppets or no-shows, please

[^2]: There is no cash value associated with the bounties, per-se, only [Fun Money](../../fun_money.md), but the cash payouts are ranked by Fun Money won, which does include the bounties.
