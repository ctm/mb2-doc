# WYWAE

## Overview

WYWAE stands for "Wish You Were At
[EMBARGO](https://www.barge.org/schedule1)".  

The WYWAE series is an
mb2 tournament dealt for each of the EMBARGO tournaments.

In 2025, there are no cash prizes.

There has never been (and never will be) an entry fee.  It's a
freeroll, although in 2025 it's a freeroll for bragging rights.

## The Tournaments

All seven tournaments will be held in January.

The first is on Thursday the 16th at 6pm Pacific.  The following three days each have two tournaments, one at 11am Pacific the other at 6pm Pacific.

The times listed in this table are all in Pacific Standard, since
that's the time zone of Las Vegas at this time of year.

In the mb2 lobby, the times will be in the time zone your
browser is configured for (which&mdash;for most people&mdash;is your
local time zone).

Each of the **times** (i.e., under the `Times` heading) in the table
below is a link to the corresponding page of the EMBARGO 2024
Structure Sheet. Each of the events is a link to the mb2 structure
sheet which will actually be used.  This is very important for CHAOS,
because the WYWAE CHAOS event is quite different from the EMBARGO
Chaos No Limit Hold'em event.

Although the EMBARGO Structure Sheet is provided as a reference, this
series is not sanctioned, endorsed or in any other way sponsored or
related to the BARGE organization.  It is being put on by Craft Poker Co.,
a completely unrelated corporation.

## A few Differences from EMBARGO

Since this is an online event, we've made a few changes.

### FM 100 Buy-in (except for the Bounty PLO)

Each event has an FM 100 buy-in. Mb2 accounts are allowed to go
negative, so you do not need Fun Money to enter or re-enter.  The
Bounty PLO tournament has an FM 150 buy-in so that FM 50 can be paid
as a bounty each time someone busts.

### Round Duration

All rounds are five minutes long.

### Breaks at 55 past the hour

The WYWAE breaks will begin after each table has finished a hand at or after 55 minutes
after the hour. The break will then be five minutes long.

### Late Registration

In the WYWAE tournaments, late registration will be allowed through level 9.

### Re-entries

During WYWAE tournaments, you may re-enter up to two times, through level 9 for
all tournaments except CHAOS, which allows up to five re-entries.  If that is
too chaotic for you, don't play.

[^2]: There is no cash value associated with the bounties, only [Fun Money](../../fun_money.md).
