The first four were put together and run in 2020 and early 2021 as
substitutes for the normally-in-a-casino BARGE, FARGO, ATLARGE and
EMBARGO events. Each of those four series were private. In order to
even see the tournaments in the lobby, a player needed to be
authorized.

Although not nearly as much fun as meeting in person, the substitute
series were fun and well-received. However, they're in the past and
there's not much point to documenting them in this book.
