# WYWAB

## Overview

WYWAB stands for "Wish You Were At
[BARGE](https://www.barge.org/barge-2023-schedule)".  WYWAB is a series of
mb2 tournaments that use the same tournament structures (and typically same
starting times) as most of the tournaments that are spread at BARGE.

WYWAB tournaments are open to all and they're free.

The winner of each tournament will receive $50 via Venmo or Zelle.

## The Tournaments

All eight tournaments will be held in July.

The times listed in this table are all in Pacific Daylight, since that's what
is on the structure sheet due to it being the time zone of Las Vegas.
However, in the mb2, the times will be in the time zone your browser
is configured for (which&mdash;for most people&mdash;is your local time zone).

Each of the events in the table below is a link to the appropriate
page of the [BARGE 2023 Structure
Sheet](https://omaholic.com/2023_BARGE_Structures.pdf). Although
the BARGE Structure Sheet is being used as a reference, this series
is not sanctioned, endorsed or in any other way sponsored or related
to the BARGE organization.  It is being put on by Craft Poker Co., a
completely unrelated corporation.

## Some Differences

Mb2, the software used to run the tournaments is very flexible, but WYWAB was
put together quickly, as such, two of the complex-to-implement structures are
not being dealt at all (NLHE Crapshoot tournament and 3 Hand Hold'em).

For the tournaments that are being dealt, some differences are just to
improve the online experience and keep the tournaments from taking too
long:

1. Except for the Tournament of Champions style tournament, rounds
will last ten minutes.  The Tournament of Champions style tournament
has seven and a half minute Hold'em rounds, nine minute Stud rounds
and eleven minute Omaha/8 rounds.
2. There are no chip races.
3. Breaks will start "on the 55", meaning that once each table has finished
a hand after fifty-five minutes after the hour, all tables will get a five
minute break.

These differences, however, are due to a lack of time:

1. In any tournament with a big blind ante, the ante will be posted _before_
the big blind.  That means if you only have a fraction of the big blind
after paying the ante, you may only win the ante plus the amount of chips
you get when you multiply that fraction of the big blind by the number of
players who also put in that much or more.
2. Final tables of mixed game tournaments do not restart the mix at the
beginning. So, for example, although the Limit 6 Game HORSE tournament will
start with Hold'em, the final table will continue dealing whatever it was
dealing before the other table was merged into it.
3. The "No Limit Hold'em Go the Distance Bounty" tournament will be played
until there is only one player left. That's the player who wins the $50.  As
such, there are ten additional levels.
