# WYWAE

## Overview

WYWAE stands for "Wish You Were At
[EMBARGO](https://www.barge.org/schedule1)".  The WYWAE series was an
mb2 tournament dealt for each of the EMBARGO tournaments.  There was no
fee to enter and entry was available to the public.

The winner of each
tournament will receive either an engraved [Solid Crystal Faceted
Emerald Cut Desk Weight
](https://www.trophies2go.com/solid-crystal-faceted-emerald-cut-desk-weight.html)
or has received $50 via Venmo or Zelle (each winner got to choose).

## The Tournaments

All five tournaments were held in February. The first was on Thursday the 9th,
then the following two days each had two tournaments.

The times listed in this table are all in Pacific Standard, since that's what
was on the structure sheet due to it being the time zone of Las Vegas.
However, in the mb2, the times will be in the time zone your browser
is configured for (which&mdash;for most people&mdash;is your local time zone).

Each of the events in the table below is a link to the appropriate
page of the [EMBARGO 2023 Structure
Sheet](https://irp.cdn-website.com/7fa840da/files/uploaded/2023_EMBARGO_Structures.pdf). Although
the EMBARGO Structure Sheet is being used as a reference, this series
was not sanctioned, endorsed or in any other way sponsored or related
to the BARGE organization.  It was put on by Craft Poker Co., a
completely unrelated corporation.
