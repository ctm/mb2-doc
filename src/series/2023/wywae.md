# WYWAE

## Overview

WYWAE stands for "Wish You Were At
[EMBARGO](https://www.barge.org/schedule1)".  The WYWAE series is an
mb2 tournament dealt for each of the EMBARGO tournaments.  There is no
fee to enter and entry is available to the public.

The winner of each
tournament will receive either an engraved [Solid Crystal Faceted
Emerald Cut Desk Weight
](https://www.trophies2go.com/solid-crystal-faceted-emerald-cut-desk-weight.html)
or $50 via Venmo or Zelle (each winner gets to choose).

### Tell Your Friends

If you know people who are sufficiently adventuresome to hop on a new
(to them) platform and play new (to them) games, but to play seriously
(i.e., show up and try to win via skill), please tell them about both
this series and the likelihood of other series (e.g. WSOP-Style and
WYwAB) later in the year.  It's certainly late notice, but as long as they
show up in good faith, the more the merrier and they'll get some experience
with the platform well before the other series are officially announced.

#### I Won't be Playing

I ([deadhead](https://ctm.github.io/docs/yld/a_public_life.html)) think
almost everyone in the BARGE community believes that I
wouldn't cheat, but the fact is that if a player plays enough hands
there will be times when that player catches a one-outer or makes a
suspicious looking call that turns out to be correct, or otherwise
does something that [might make the game looked
rigged](https://groups.google.com/a/barge.org/g/barge/c/FELSd-uTEPQ).
Since I'm encouraging newcomers to join, I will provide one fewer
distraction by not playing.

## The Tournaments

All five tournaments are held in February. The first is on Thursday the 9th,
then the following two days each have a tournament.

The times listed in this table are all in Pacific Standard, since that's what's
on the structure sheet due to it being the time zone of Las Vegas.
However, in the mb2 lobby, the times will be in the time zone your browser
is configured for (which&mdash;for most people&mdash;is your local time zone).

Each of the events in the table below is a link to the appropriate
page of the [EMBARGO 2023 Structure
Sheet](https://irp.cdn-website.com/7fa840da/files/uploaded/2023_EMBARGO_Structures.pdf). Although
the EMBARGO Structure Sheet is being used as a reference, this series
is not sanctioned, endorsed or in any other way sponsored or related
to the BARGE organization.  It is being put on by Craft Poker Co., a
completely unrelated corporation.
