# WSOP-Style 2023

## Overview

The WSOP-Style 2023 Series is a tournament a day from Tuesday,
May 30th through Tuesday, July 18th, 2023.  Each tournament will start
at:

* Monday through Friday: 5pm Pacific time (8pm Eastern)
* Saturday and Sunday: 3pm Pacific time (6pm Eastern)

Tournaments typically finish in under two hours.

## Prize for first place

Craft Poker Co. will either send a physical prize to the winner of
each tournament in the series or pay $50 in cash via Venmo or
Zelle. It will be the winner's choice. If taken, the prize will be an
[Engraved Rectangular Glass
Paperweight](https://www.trophies2go.com/engraved-rettangolo-glass-paperweight.html)
unless they run out or there are other unforeseen circumstances.

### Overall prizes

There will also be nicer prizes for the top three players on
leaderboard by profit and also by win rate at the end of the series or
$250, $125 and $85 respectively.  The prizes haven't been
nailed down yet.  To qualify for an overall win rate prize, the player
must have completed at least seven tournaments.

### All are welcome

All events in this series are open to the public. Tell anyone you know who
is already interested in online poker.

I (Cliff Matthews, aka [deadhead](https://ctm.github.io/docs/yld/))
won't be playing any of the tournaments, but more often than not I'll
be watching the tables[^2] as I work in other windows.


### No Late Registration (yet)

_**Currently**_ there is [no late
entry](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues/183), but it should be
supported "soon" (with luck, within the first two weeks of
this series).

Because there is no late registration, the tournaments don't actually
start until five minutes after the hour, but they start **exactly** at
five minutes after the hour, so if you're going to play, register in
advance and be sure that your registration check-box is checked.

### Rebuys instead of re-entries

Another major difference is that instead of re-entries, the
tournaments used rebuys.  When rebuys are available to you, there will
be a checkbox that you can check to request a rebuy when you bust.  If
that checkbox is checked, a rebuy happens immediately after you bust
and you retain the seat that you were busted in.  If that check box
wasn't checked **before** you bust, you will not be able to rebuy or
re-enter.

So, when the structure sheet says the tournament supports two
re-entries through level 15, you will be allowed (but not required) to
rebuy up to twice, but only through level 15.

## Leaderboard

Mb2 knows which tournaments belong to this series and there is a
"WSOPS 2023 LEADERBOARD" menu entry reachable from the top-line in the
lobby. It's in the middle of the reports drop-down, which is the first
small icon to the right of the circled-i.  The reports drop-down icon
itself consists of three horizontal lines, each with a dot before it.

The leaderboard tracks [Fun Money](../fun_money.md).  Each of the tournaments
had an FM 200 buy-in and Fun Money is awarded using the [BARGE Unified Payout
Schedule](../barge/payouts.md). All rebuys are for FM 200 each and all of
the Fun Money from rebuys goes directly into the prize pool,

### Round Duration

The initial rounds of each daily tournament will be five minutes long.

If the structure sheet for a tournament has longer rounds on
successive days, the levels that correspond to those days will be
longer in the same proportion.

For example, Event #22, the Limit Hold'em Championship's [structure
sheet](https://www.wsop.com/pdfs/structuresheets/structure_5219_21687.pdf)
lists Levels 1-6 as 40 minutes, 7-10 as 60 minutes and 11-end as 90
minutes.  When played here, the first six levels will be five minutes
long, since those are the initial levels. Levels seven through ten
will be seven and a half minutes long (60 / 40 * 5). The remaining
levels will be eleven and a quarter minutes long (90 / 40 * 5).

If you click on a nickname in the winner column, you can see how long
that tournament took.

## The Tournaments

The
individual tournaments will be available for registration in the
[lobby](https://ctm.github.io/docs/players_manual/lobby.html) for
several days (typically at least a week) before the start of each
tournament.

Tournament winners will typically be updated within a day
of the completion of each tournament, although there are likely to be
delays around [June 24th](https://www.wser.org/).

[^2]: I'll be doing this with the same interface everyone else uses;
there is no other interface. Nor are there any other "super-powers"
built into mb2.  Even people's hole cards aren't written to the
database until after the hand completes, so even if someone were to
get surreptitious access to the database, that hypothetical spy
couldn't see people's hole cards during a hand.

[^3]: At the World Series of Poker, this event is limited to Casino
Employees.  In this series&mdash;in 2023 at least&mdash;no events have
any such restrictions.  However, it would be nice for participants to
at least harbor warm thoughts toward casino employees while playing.

[^4]: This **may** be some sort of charity event; it's too early to
tell. There will not, under any circumstances, however, be a fee
associated with this event nor even a mandatory charity donation
requirement. _Perhaps_ Craft Poker Co. will be able to contribute
money to USO, but it may simply be a "harbor good thoughts" event.

[^5]: SAM ðŸš´6 and HOSDARSS are not (yet!) part of the World Series of
Poker.  Both of those structures were made&mdash;with great respect
and sadness&mdash;in memory of [David
Lawful](https://feldmanmemorial.com/tribute/details/4734/David-Lawful/obituary.html)
(craftpoker.com player id 22).  More details will be available
closer to tournament time.

[^6]: At the World Series of Poker, the Dealer's Choice tournaments were
scheduled for May 31st and June 3rd, but mb2 didn't deal Dealer's Choice
then, so they're schedule for these two slots which are taken by the
multi-day Main Event at the World Series.

[^7]: Each time a player completely busts (i.e. doesn't rebuy), the
player that busts the busted player will be awarded an FM 65 bounty
from the prize pool.
