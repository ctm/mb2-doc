# WSOP-Style 2023

## Overview

The WSOP-Style 2023 Series was initially to have been a tournament a
day from Tuesday, May 30th through Tuesday, July 18th, 2023.  Each
tournament started at:

* Monday through Friday: 5pm Pacific time (8pm Eastern)
* Saturday and Sunday: 3pm Pacific time (6pm Eastern)

All but six of the tournaments finished in under two and a half hours.
The Razz Championship lasted three hours, eleven minutes.

Four of the fifty tournaments had trouble and were rescheduled as
documented in the footnotes of the table below.

## Prize for first place

Craft Poker Co. either sent a physical prize to the winner of
each tournament in the series or paid $50 in cash via Venmo or
Zelle. It was the winner's choice. When taken, the prize was an
[Engraved Rectangular Glass
Paperweight](https://www.trophies2go.com/engraved-rettangolo-glass-paperweight.html).

### Overall prizes

There were also larger cash awards for the top three players on the
leaderboard by profit and also by win rate at the end of the series.
Those awards were $250, $125 and $85 for first, second and third.

To qualify for an overall win rate prize, the player must had to have
completed at least seven tournaments.

#### Net Profit

|RANK|PROFIT|NICK|

|3rd|5,484|smalltalkdan|

#### Win Rate

|RANK|#|RATE|NICK|
|----|-|----|----|
|1st|8|1.62|samarai|
|2nd|22|1.00|Maverick600|
|3rd|22|0.64|JADCðŸš´|

### All were welcome

All events in this series were open to the public, although they weren't
well publicized.

### No Late Registration

During the series, late registration was not yet available (it is
now).  Because there was no late registration, the tournaments didn't
actually start until five minutes after the hour, but they started
**exactly** at five minutes after the hour.

### Rebuys instead of re-entries

Another major difference is that instead of re-entries, the
tournaments used rebuys.  When rebuys were available to you, there was
a checkbox that you could have checked to request a rebuy when you bust.  If
that checkbox was checked, a rebuy happened immediately after you bust
and you retained the seat that you were busted in.  If that check box
wasn't checked **before** you bust, you were not able to rebuy or
re-enter.

So, when the structure sheet said the tournament supports two
re-entries through level 15, you were allowed (but not required) to
rebuy up to twice, but only through level 15.

## Leaderboard

Mb2 knows which tournaments belong to this series and there is a
"WSOPS 2023 LEADERBOARD" menu entry reachable from the top-line in the
lobby. It's in the middle of the reports drop-down, which is the first
small icon to the right of the circled-i.  The reports drop-down icon
itself consists of three horizontal lines, each with a dot before it.

The leaderboard tracks [Fun Money](/fun_money.md).  Each of the tournaments
had an FM 200 buy-in and Fun Money is awarded using the [BARGE Unified Payout
Schedule](/barge/payouts.md). All rebuys are for FM 200 each and all of
the Fun Money from rebuys goes directly into the prize pool,

### Round Duration

The initial rounds of each daily tournament was five minutes long.

If the structure sheet for a tournament had longer rounds on
successive days, the levels that correspond to those days were
longer in the same proportion.

For example, Event #22, the Limit Hold'em Championship's [structure
sheet](https://www.wsop.com/pdfs/structuresheets/structure_5219_21687.pdf)
listed Levels 1-6 as 40 minutes, 7-10 as 60 minutes and 11-end as 90
minutes.  When played here, the first six levels were five minutes
long, since those are the initial levels. Levels seven through ten
were seven and a half minutes long (60 / 40 * 5). The remaining
levels were eleven and a quarter minutes long (90 / 40 * 5).

If you click on a nickname in the winner column, you can see how long
that tournament took.

## The Tournaments

The
individual tournaments were available for registration in the
[lobby](https://ctm.github.io/docs/players_manual/lobby.html) for
several days (typically at least a week) before the start of each
tournament.

Tournament winners were typically be updated within a day
of the completion of each tournament, although there were
delays around [June 24th](https://www.wser.org/).

[^3]: At the World Series of Poker, this event was limited to Casino
Employees.  In this series&mdash;in 2023 at least&mdash;no events had
any such restrictions.  However, participants were encouraged to
harbor warm thoughts toward casino employees while playing.

[^4]: This **was not** a charity event in 2023.

[^5]: SAM ðŸš´6 and HOSDARSS are not (yet!) part of the World Series of
Poker.  Both of those structures were made&mdash;with great respect
and sadness&mdash;in memory of [David
Lawful](https://feldmanmemorial.com/tribute/details/4734/David-Lawful/obituary.html)
(craftpoker.com player id 22).

[^6]: At the World Series of Poker, the Dealer's Choice tournaments
were scheduled for May 31st and June 3rd, but mb2 didn't deal Dealer's
Choice then, so they were scheduled for these two slots which had been
taken by the multi-day Main Event at the World Series.

[^8]: This was supposed to be the Dealer's Choice Championship, but a bug
made it a 21-game Mix. All the Dealer's Choice games were played in succession
with nobody making a choice.

[^9]: This was supposed to the PLO Bounty tournament, but it was actually
the Lucky 7's structure (which included unlimited rebuys up through
Level 22).

[^10]: The way I tried to clean up the mislabeled tournaments error caused mb2
to start some players with too few tournament chips, so that tournament does
not count toward WSOPS standings, but the (post-BARGE) replacement did.

[^11]: The tournament was aborted in the middle.  I had started a
deploy and taken a short nap and something caused the deploy to take
way too long and I didn't notice it.

[^7]: An FM 65 bounty from the prize pool was awarded each time a player
was completely busted (i.e. was busted and didn't rebuy) from the tournament.
The bounty was awarded to the player who was considered the "buster".

[^12]: Although July 29th, 2023 was a Saturday, this tournament ran at
5pm Pacific, like each of the other three make-up (post-WSOP / post-BARGE)
WSOP-Style tournaments that immediately preceded it.
