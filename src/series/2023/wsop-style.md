# WSOP-Style 2023

## Overview

The WSOP-Style 2023 Series will be (at least[^1]) a tournament a day from
Tuesday, May 30th through Tuesday, July 18th, 2023.  Each tournament will
start at 3pm Pacific time (6pm Eastern).

_**Currently**_ there is [no late
entry](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues/183), but it should be
supported "soon" (with luck, within the first week of
tournaments).

Another major difference is that instead of re-entries, the
tournaments used rebuys.  A rebuy happens immediately after you bust
and you retain the seat that you were busted in.  So, when the
structure sheet says the tournament supports two re-entries through
level 15, you will be allowed (but not required) to rebuy up to twice,
but only through level 15.

All events in this series are open to the public. Tell anyone you know who
is already interested in online poker.

I (Cliff Matthews, aka [deadhead](https://ctm.github.io/docs/yld/))
won't be playing any of the tournaments, but more often than not I'll
be watching the tables[^2] as I work in other windows.


## Prize for first place

Craft Poker Co. will either send a physical prize to the winner of
each tournament in the series or pay $50 in cash via Venmo or
Zelle. It will be the winner's choice. If taken, the prize will be an
[Engraved Rectangular Glass
Paperweight](https://www.trophies2go.com/engraved-rettangolo-glass-paperweight.html)
unless they run out or there are other unforeseen circumstances.

There will also be nicer prizes for the top three leaderboard at the
end of the series or $250, $125 and $85 respectively, although the
prizes haven't been nailed down yet.

## Leaderboard

Mb2 knows which tournaments belonged to this series and there will be a
"WSOPS Leaderboard" available from the lobby.

The leaderboard tracks [Fun Money](../fun_money.md).  Each of the tournaments
had an FM 200 buy-in and Fun Money is awarded using the [BARGE Unified Payout
Schedule](../barge/payouts.md). All rebuys are for FM 200 each and all of
the Fun Money from rebuys goes directly into the prize pool,

## The Tournaments

This table will be fully populated by the start of the series.

The
individual tournaments will be available for registration in the
[lobby](https://ctm.github.io/docs/players_manual/lobby.html) for
several days (typically at least a week) before the start of each
tournament.

Tournament winners will typically be updated within a day
of the completion of each tournament, although there are likely to be
delays around [June 24th](https://www.wser.org/).

[^1]: There is may be an extra Dealer's Choice tournament added to the
schedule, since the June 3rd event is Paradise Road Pick'em and not
Dealer's Choice.  That substitution was necessary because mb2's
Dealer's Choice implementation was not finished in time to put it into
the early lineup.

[^2]: I'll be doing this with the same interface everyone else uses;
there is no other interface. Nor are there any other "super-powers"
built into mb2.  Even people's hole cards aren't written to the
database until after the hand completes, so even if someone were to
get surreptitious access to the database, that hypothetical spy
couldn't see people's hole cards during a hand.

[^3]: At the World Series of Poker, this event is limited to Casino
Employees.  In this series&mdash;in 2023 at least&mdash;no events have
any such restrictions.  However, it would be nice for participants to
at least harbor warm thoughts toward casino employees while playing.

[^4]: This **may** be some sort of charity event; it's too early to
tell. There will not, under any circumstances, however, be a fee
associated with this event nor even a mandatory charity donation
requirement. _Perhaps_ Craft Poker Co. will be able to contribute
money to USO, but it may simply be a "harbor good thoughts" event.

[^5]: At the World Series of Poker The Dealer's Choice tournaments were
scheduled for May 31st and June 3rd, but mb2 didn't deal Dealer's Choice
then, so they're schedule for these two slots which are taken by the
multi-day Main Event at the World Series.
