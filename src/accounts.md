# Accounts

Accounts are free.

You may create more than one, but please don't mislead.

Currently, no email account is associated with an account. Mb2's
purpose is to provide fun, not to sell you things or collect (much
less sell) your information. Mb2 currently doesn't even use cookies,
nor does it record your IP address.

### No Password Recovery, Only Reset

Your password is never stored in a database. Instead, a hash of a hash
of your password is stored (the first hash is done on the client side
so that your password is not sent to the server). Consequently there's
no way for anyone associated with mb2 to recover (or even observe)
your password.  Since mb2 doesn't use email addresses, the only way to
have your password reset is to ask (e.g., via chat or email).  So,
when you create an account, please remember or write down your
password.
