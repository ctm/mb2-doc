# Accounts

Accounts are free.

You may create more than one, but please don't mislead.

Currently, no email account is associated with an account. Mb2's
purpose is to provide fun, not to sell you things or collect your
information. Mb2 currently doesn't even use cookies, nor does it
record your IP address.

Your password is never stored in a database. Instead, a hash of your
password is stored. That means there's no way for anyone associated
with mb2 to recover your password.  Since mb2 doesn't use email
addresses, the only way to have your password reset is to ask (e.g.,
via chat or email).  So, when you create an account, please remember
or write down your password.
