# Lobby

After you sign in, you'll be in the lobby, where you can see the active
tables, a list of upcoming tournaments and recent chat.

![Lobby](./lobby.png "Lobby")


The [top line](./lobby/top_line.html) in the lobby starts with the
nickname you've logged in as. After that are icons.

The second line lists the others logged in.

If any tables are active, each gets a row with the table id and a list
of the players at that table.  The table id itself is a link.  If you
click on it, you'll get a new window that allows you to observe that table.

Any upcoming tournaments that you're allowed to join are listed below.
To join, click the check-box.  If you change your mind before
the tournament starts, click the check-box again and your buy-in will
be refunded and you won't be in the tournament when it starts.

When you join a tournament there may be esoteric options that you can
choose via a pull-down in the right most column.  They should be
self-explanatory.  Above that column is the little white plus sign
that brings up the tournament creation modal dialog (see below).

The column labeled `#` is the number of players currently signed up.  If
you want to see which players are signed up, bring your cursor over that
number and the entrants' nicknames will be revealed.

The starting time is in the timezone that your browser is configured
to display.  That's normally the timezone you're in, but check the
three letter timezone abbreviation to be sure.

A synopsis of the tournament structure is in the `Tournament` column.
If you bring your cursor over the synopsis, more details will drop
down.

The rest of the lobby is chat and a box for you to type your own chat.
All chat is logged, but only the chat from the last twenty-four hours
is displayed when you log in.
