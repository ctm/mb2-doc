# Craft Poker Co.

Founded in 2019, incorporated in Nevada in 2022, Craft Poker Co. (CPC) is a
C Corporation.

### Ownership

There are 15,750 shares of common stock. All are owned by Clifford Matthews.

There are 2,530 shares of Series A Preferred Stock:

|Shares|Shareholder|
|--:|--|
|1,200|Bill Savage|
|750|Lee Ward|
|300|Charles Haynes|
|40|Anonymous BARGEr #1|
|200|Anonymous BARGEr #2|
|40|Anonymous BARGEr #3|

An additional 1,520 shares of Series A Preferred Stock have been authorized
to be sold to accredited investors and through the Title3Funds Equity
Crowdfunding Portal.

Series A Preferred shares come with a liquidity preference. Should CPC
or CPC's software be sold without conversion, the net of the sale is
split in half, with one half going to the Series A Preferred
Shareholders pro-rata and the other half going to the common stock
shareholders pro-rata[^1].

Conversion happens only if at least one million dollars is raised at a
pre-investment valuation of ten million dollars ($10MM) or more, or if
the sale price is itself ten million dollars or more.

|--|--:|
|Authorized Series A Preferred|4,050|
|Outstanding Series A Preferred Shares|2,530|
|Available Series A Preferred for Sale|1,520|
|Minimum Series A Preferred Sale|100|

|Outstanding Common Shares|15,750|
|Post Conversion Minimum Shares|18,380|
|Post Conversion Maximum Shares|19,800

With a sale price of $175 per Series A Preferred Share, the following
are amounts are restatements of the above information.

|||
|--|--:|
|Price per Series A Preferred Share|$175|
|Pre-Overhead Min Raise|$17,500|
|Pre-Overhead Full Raise|$266,000|
|Minimum Break-Even|$920,500|
|Full Raise Break-Even|$1,417,500|
|||
|Minimum pre-investment||
|Conversion Valuation|$10,000,000|

Should conversion occur, the minimum value of each Series A Preffered
Share would be $10MM / 19,800 = $505.05, which is 2.88 times $175.

Were CPC sold for less than $10MM, each Series A Preffered Share would
be worth at least[^2] the net of the sale divided by 8,100, so a
$1,417,500 net would be break-even, where a $3MM sale would return
$370 per share.

[^1]: Another way of saying that is that Cliff gets
half of the proceeds and the other half is split amongst the Series A
Preferred Shareholders. The liquidity preference, along with many other
terms are provided in the Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement.

[^2]: The figure here assumes all 1,520 Series A Preferred Shares have
been sold. Were CPC to be sold with fewer than 1,520 Series A
Preferred Shares sold, the value per share of the shares that _were_
sold would be higher.
