# Fun Money

Mb2 "keeps score" by tracking "Fun Money", an abstraction of what a
real life poker player spends and perhaps wins while playing poker.

## No Intrinsic Value

Mb2 keeps track of how much Fun Money you spend and win.  It's a point
system that helps keep the playing of virtual poker fun and challenging.
Although it has no intrinsic worth, players are encouraged to take it
semi-seriously, because, for mb2's intended player-base, playing with
people who are all taking it semi-seriously is more fun!

## You start with Zero, but&hellip;

When you create an mb2 account, you start with no Fun Money. However, most
events allow you to participate by running a deficit. You can lessen your
deficit and run a surplus by winning.

### Buy-ins

The only thing you can spend Fun Money on is buying into events, i.e. [Tournaments](./tournaments.html) or [Ring Games](./ring_games.html).

### Pay-outs

The three ways you can gain Fun Money are:
1. Finishing high in a tournament
2. Busting a player in a bounty tournament
3. Leaving a Ring Game with more chips than you entered with
