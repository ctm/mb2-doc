# Ring Games

Ring games, also known as cash games (even though no cash is involved),
are the non-tournament form of poker.

In a Ring Game, you choose how much of your Fun Money you want to
bring to the table, where it's converted to chips.  You then play at
the table as long as you want and when you leave your chips are converted
back to Fun Money. If you gain chips at the table, then when you leave
you'll have gained Fun Money, but if you lose chips at the table, the
net effect will be that you lost Fun Money.

## Not Supported Yet

Although there's a brief description of Ring Games here and a few
mentions of them elsewhere in this Players' Manual, Ring Games are
currently unsupported.  The server knows a bit&mdash;but definitely
not all&mdash;about Ring Games but the client knows very little.
