# Chat

The lobby and the table windows allow you to type messages.

Messages typed in the lobby can be seen by anyone logged in or anyone
who logs in in the next twenty-four hours.

Messages typed in tables can be seen by anyone playing at or
observing those tables.  Observers can be logged in or anonymous.

All chat is preceded by the nickname of the author of the chat. Normal
messages then have a colon before the message. Action messages do not
have the colon.

## Special Formatting

### Action Messages

If you preface your message with "/me ", your message will be
displayed in italics.  E.g., if I type 
> /me applauds

the output will be 

> _deadhead applauds_

### Links

You can create a link that other people can click on by surrounding the
label for the link in `[]` and then, with no space after the closing `]`,
putting the complete URL within `()`.  E.g., if I type
> \[DuckDuckGo]\(https://duckduckgo.com/) is my search engine.

the output will be

[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) is my search engine.

### Emojis

You can either type (or paste) emojis in as utf-8 or you can use [GitHub
codes](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908) for emojis.  E.g., if I
type
> Yup! I hit my two outer. :grinning:

the output will be

> Yup! I hit my two outer. ğŸ˜€
