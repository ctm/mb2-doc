# Tournaments

Mb2 is currently tournament-centric.  This is mostly a side-effect of
tournaments being more complicated than [ring games](./ring_games.html).
Sometimes when creating a new architecture for a software project, it
makes sense to implement the more complicated parts first, especially
if the less complicated parts are in some sense a subset of more
complicated ones.

## Joining and Unjoining

Currently Mb2 [doesn't support late
registration](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues/183), so to
participate in a tournament you have to join before it starts.

The tournaments that you're allowed to join show up in the lobby.  Each
has a checkbox to the left. If you mark the checkbox, then when that
tournament starts, you'll be included. If you change your mind, just
uncheck the box.

## Creating

The [Tournament Creation](./lobby/new_event.html) page is in the Lobby
sub-section of this manual, because you create a new tournament by
clicking on a circled plus sign that's in the lobby.
