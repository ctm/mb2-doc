# Tournaments

Mb2 is currently tournament-centric.  This is mostly a side-effect of
tournaments being more complicated than [ring games](./ring_games.html).
Sometimes when creating a new architecture for a software project, it
makes sense to implement the more complicated parts first, especially
if the less complicated parts are in some sense a subset of more
complicated ones.

## Joining and Unjoining

The tournaments that you're allowed to join show up in the lobby.
Each has a checkbox to the left. If you mark the checkbox before that
tournament starts, then when it starts, you'll be included. If you
change your mind, just uncheck the box.

### Late Registration

After a tournament has started, if the tournament supports late registration,
you can click the check-box and join that tournament in progress.  If
there is a seat open, you'll be seated immediately.  If not, a new table
may need to be created and that will only be done when there are enough
movable players (players not in a hand) on the existing tables to move
enough to create a new table, but keep things balanced.

### Re-entry

Some tournaments allow re-entry. To re-enter a tournament, you click the
same check-box you used to enter. However, not all tournaments allow any
re-entry and those that do often limit each player to one or two re-entries.
Additionally, the re-entry window typically closes at the end of a level
(e.g., "Level 9") and the re-entry automatically closes as soon as the
number of players left meets the minimum number of places pay (i.e., each
remaining player is guaranteed to win some [Fun Money](/fun_money.md)).


## Creating

The [Tournament Creation](./lobby/new_event.html) page is in the Lobby
sub-section of this manual, because you create a new tournament by
clicking on a circled plus sign that's in the lobby.
