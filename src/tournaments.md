# Tournaments

Mb2 is currently tournament-centric.  This is mostly a side-effect of
tournaments being more complicated than [ring games](./ring_games.html).
Sometimes when creating a new architecture for a software project, it
makes sense to implement the more complicated parts first, especially
if the less complicated parts are in some sense a subset of more
complicated ones.

## Joining and Unjoining

The tournaments that you're allowed to join show up in the lobby.
Each has a checkbox to the left. If you mark the checkbox before that
tournament starts, then when it starts, you'll be included. If you
change your mind, just uncheck the box.

After a tournament has started, if the tournament supports late registration
and there is a seat available, you can click the check-box and join that
tournament in progress.

If late registration is available and all the seats
are occupied, you will not be allowed to join until someone busts.  There
is not yet a waitlist, so if more than one person is waiting for a seat to
open, the first to click after it is open will get it and the other(s) will
be shut out.

Eventually, mb2's late registration will have the option of allowing new
tables to be created as needed, but until then, if you want to be sure you
get a seat, sign up before the tournament starts.


## Creating

The [Tournament Creation](./lobby/new_event.html) page is in the Lobby
sub-section of this manual, because you create a new tournament by
clicking on a circled plus sign that's in the lobby.
