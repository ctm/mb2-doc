# 2024-10-29 Micro Status Report

At 9:12pm, Tuesday October 29th, I sent the following email to people who had
expressed interest in investing. The only change I have made is that I have
redacted my cell number.  If you're reading this and you think you should know
my cell number, send me email and I'll share it.

> This is shorter than I expected it to be, but I did say I'd get something out today.

> I've caught up on my investor related email, so anyone who has expressed interest is on my spreadsheet. There are currently nineteen people on the list, expressing interest in 116 shares, with a few people expressing interest in one share, one person for 20, a fifteen and four 10s.

> It took me forever to post to Poker Peeps, but I finally did that, minutes ago. I have not yet sent out email to people who have expressed interest in investing previously, because I got caught up in non-work email.

> If any interest trickles in, I'll reply ASAP and add people to the spreadsheet, but I probably won't try to track down others until I do two things that I can do now that I have an idea of the level of interest: contact CPC's business attorney and get our Stock Purchase Agreement up to date and contact Title 3 Funds to make sure that they still want CPC as a client. I should be able to get that done tomorrow.

> If all goes well, you probably won't hear anything more from me about this for over a week, because I'll be getting "i"s dotted, "t"s crossed, working on the SEC "Form C" and doing more outreach. I also will be taking a little time off to go out and attempt the Deadman Peaks Trail 100 miler, which starts Saturday morning and ends Sunday late afternoon. It's only a two hour drive from here, so it won't consume as much of my time as the Javelina Jundred. It will, however, interfere with my sleep through Monday.

> My cell is **\[Redacted]**. I sometimes get a bit behind in email, so if you ever need to get in touch with me and email doesn't work, try texting me.
