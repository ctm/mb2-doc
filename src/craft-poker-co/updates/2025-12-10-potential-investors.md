# 2025-12-10 email to potential investors

On Wednesday, December 10th, 2025, I sent the following email to each
of the twenty-two people who had previously expressed interest in
investing in Craft Poker Co. The only changes I've made here are to
use markdown to supply links, _italics_ and **bold** and I've ommitted
the PDF attachment that is named `NM Complaint Signed
2025_04_07_15_10_01 with Cancellation Letter.pdf`.

# The email

Hi your-name-here,

I apologize for this being a form letter, but I'm sending this individually (using copy and paste) to twenty-two people and I want to send everyone exactly the same thing (which I'll then put in the updates section of the Players' Manual). Previously, I wrote one email and bcc'd it to everyone, however, that meant that as each person replied, although the reply only went to me, it got appended to a single line in my INBOX and led me to overlook some replies. So, although cut-and-paste is error-prone in the sending, I think it'll lead to me making fewer errors in the replying.

On December 4th, I finalized a [status report](./2025-12-4-status.md) that I spent a couple weeks thinking about. If you still may be interested in investing in Craft Poker Co., I hope you'll read it. It mentions an offer to send a twelve page PDF, but rather than make you uncomfortable and have to ask for it, I've attached it to this email. The PDF will not, however, be posted in the updates section.

My spreadsheet has you as one of twenty-two people who expressed interest--over a year ago--in investing in Craft Poker Co. I now need that investment more than ever, but that is a major red flag and should give you pause. Furthermore, I can only accept investment from [accredited investors](https://www.sec.gov/resources-small-businesses/capital-raising-building-blocks/accredited-investors) and my guess is about half of the twenty-two may be accredited. The good news is that if you're non-accredited (or are accredited but don't want to step up to the plate quite yet), you get a freeroll, because you're on my spreadsheet.

If you're an accredited investor and you've read my status report and you still want to invest, let me know as soon as it's convenient. I'm in no rush; laggards can't be rushers. 

If you're not an accredited investor (or if you just want the freeroll), just say that you can't invest now, but you'd like the ability to buy  in the future the amount of shares that you're listed for on the spreadsheet. It's a crazy freeroll, because what it'll mean is that once we can sell to non-accredited investors, I'll hold ten shares in reserve, then do the offering and _assuming I pull in the minimum from the offering_, I'll give you the difference in cash between the amount your shares would have cost "today" and however much the equivalent number of shares cost at that point, whether you then buy the shares or not. At least I **think** it's legal for me to do that.

For what it's worth, it won't bother me in the least should you or anyone choose not to invest. At minimum, I certainly appear to be flakey and I may indeed be a flake. I actually take Craft Poker Co. exceedingly seriously, but if one or more BARGErs were to create some sort of opportunity to bet against me, it wouldn't phase me; in fact, I'd be amused.

If you're on the fence, or just want as much information as possible, I plan on posting to the BARGE list ["soon"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2y8Sx4B2Sk) with a link to a [podcast that I'm in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc7dHMSU4wA), with a bit of an explanation as to how it relates to Craft Poker Co. and my life in general. One could make a very good argument that I spend too much time running and not enough time on my company. I even sort of believe that when I'm tired, but I think it's more nuanced than that and I think I can articulate my thoughts, but I never know until I try.
