# craftpoker.com

While Craft Poker Co. is the name of the company,
[craftpoker.com](https://craftpoker.com) is the name of the site.

Here's a super abbreviated version of what I plan for craftpoker.com
* Play money only
* Anyone can play for free, but only in public tournaments and public ring games
* For $5/month (free for [players whose id is 99 or less](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues/579#issuecomment-1552163018)) a player can create and administer a club
* At the $5/month rate, each club's membership can include the player who creates the club and up to nine other members
* The membership in a club is dynamic and members can be swapped in and out trivially
* Larger clubs can be created by having some of the members also be paying customers (e.g., two paying members can have a club with eighteen non-paying members)
* Or, larger clubs can be created by having the paying member pay more than $5/month (e.g. pay $10/month and have up to nineteen non-paying members)
* Club activities can be public or private
* There will be different ways to keep score, with tools for administering them
* Administrators will be able to create their own tournament and ring game mixes (combinations of games played in rotation)
* Administrators will be able to create their own tournament structures (starting chips, levels, blinds, breaks)
* Paying members will also have more/better history & statistics (this one is a bit hand-wavy, but, as an example, it may be that free players can only request hand histories from the last 24 hours, while paying members can request all their hand histories, etc.)
* No other fees, no upselling, no buying of play chips
* "No"[^1] dark patterns
  * No collection of unnecessary user data
  * No selling, trading or sharing of user data
  * No ads
  * Trivial to quit
  * etc.
* Assuming Craft Poker Co. has sufficient capital, while the above is being developed, there will also be great improvements to the User Interface, allowing mb2 to be played on tablets "soon" and the ability to play on phones being a high priority (albeit too far away for me to say more just yet).

[^1]: This requires rewording, because one could make a good argument
that closed source itself is a dark pattern. Similarly, the artificial
scarcity of low user-ids could be seen as a dark pattern rather than
simply a way to reward early adopters. Finally&mdash;and it's a
stretch&mdash;one could view the scoring systems as having a FOMO
(Fear Of Missing Out) side-effect.
