# Poker, with your friends

Mb2 is poker software with a nice friendly player base.

Mb2 is in an early stage of development.  The server is world-class,
full-featured and state-of-the art.  However, the user interface is currently
mostly unstyled.

The server improves almost every day. The styling of the user interface has
slipped repeatedly, but has not been forgotten nor is it being ignored.

### Read no further, Try the [Demo](https://craftpoker.com)

Although ugly, the user interface is _mostly_ self explanatory.  As
such, you can try the [demo](https://craftpoker.com) and only come back to
this document if you're curious.

There's more information about the demo on the next page of this book.
To advance to the next page, scroll to the bottom of this page and
then click the `>` in the lower right corner.

### Come back for a tournament

Although you can create your own tournaments and have them start
whenever you want, typically, at least one tournament is scheduled each day
that is attended by regulars.

The tournaments have [Fun Money](fun_money.md) and bragging
rights as a prize and the winner gets the privilege of picking
the structure for the same tournament on the next day (e.g., the
winner of the night tournament chooses the structure for the night
tournament the next day).

The evening tournament starts at 5:05 pm Pacific.

The night tournament&mdash;when it runs&mdash;starts at 8:10 pm Pacific. 

So, look for one of the regularly scheduled tournaments in the
[lobby](lobby.md) and join us.

### This manual is&hellip; Player Driven

Maintaining this documentation is currently, low-priority.

The regular players already know most of the information herein and
"outsiders" become insiders simply by joining and playing. However, if
there's anything you're curious about, ask in the lobby. Not only is
it likely that someone will answer, but your question and its answer
may well make it into this manual and help someone else.
