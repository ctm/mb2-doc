# Poker, with your friends

Mb2 is poker software with a nice friendly player base.

Mb2 is in an early stage of development.  The server is world-class,
full-featured and state-of-the art.  However, the user interface is currently
mostly unstyled.

The server improves almost every day. The styling of the user interface has
slipped repeatedly, but has not been forgotten nor is it being ignored.

### Read no further, Try the [Demo](https://devctm.com)

Although ugly, the user interface is _mostly_ self explanatory.  As
such, you can try the [demo](https://devctm.com) and only come back to
this document if you're curious.

There's more information about the demo on the next page of this book.
To advance to the next page, scroll to the bottom of this page and

### Come back at 5pm Pacific, or 8pm Pacific

Although you can create your own tournaments, two tournaments are
typically scheduled each day. You can win bragging rights and the
privilege to pick the structure for the same tournament on the
following day (e.g., the winner of the evening tournament chooses the
structure for the evening tournament for the following day).

The evening
tournament begins at 5pm Pacific and the night tournament at 8pm
Pacific.  So, figure out what time they start in your time zone and
join us.

### This manual is&hellip; Player Driven

Maintaining this documentation is currently, low-priority.

The regular players already know most of the information herein and
"outsiders" become insiders simply by joining and playing. However, if
there's anything you're curious about, ask in the lobby. Not only is
it likely that someone will answer, but your question and its answer
may well make it into this manual and help someone else.
