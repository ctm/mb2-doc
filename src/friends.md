# Poker, with your friends

Mb2 is poker software with a nice friendly player base.

Mb2 is in an early stage of development.  The server is world-class,
full-featured and state-of-the art.  However, the user interface is currently
mostly unstyled.

The server improves almost every day. The styling of the user interface has
slipped repeatedly, but has not been forgotten nor is it being ignored.

### Read no further, Try the [Demo](https://craftpoker.com)

Although ugly, the user interface is _mostly_ self explanatory.  As
such, you can try the [demo](https://craftpoker.com) and only come back to
this document if you're curious.

There's more information about the demo on the next page of this book.
To advance to the next page, scroll to the bottom of this page and

### Come back for the tournaments

Although you can create your own tournaments and have them start
whenever you want, typically, at least one tournament is scheduled each day.

Thursday, February 1st, 2024, Friday the 2nd, and Saturday, the 3rd,
[craftpoker.com](https://craftpoker.com) is hosting
[WYWAE](series/2024/wywae.md), which is a series of five free tournaments
whose winner gets $100 cash (via Venmo or Zelle). 

Click on the 
[WYWAE](series/2024/wywae.md) link for details, including the time of each
of the tournaments.

After WYWAE is over (at least until the WSOP-Style Series begins), the
tournaments will only have bragging rights as a prize, although the
winner does get the privilege to pick the structure for the same
tournament on the next day (e.g., the winner of the night tournament
chooses the structure for the night tournament the next day).

The non-WYWAE evening tournament starts at 5:05 pm Pacific.

The night tournament starts at 8:10 pm Pacific. 

So, figure out what time they start in your time zone and join us.

### This manual is&hellip; Player Driven

Maintaining this documentation is currently, low-priority.

The regular players already know most of the information herein and
"outsiders" become insiders simply by joining and playing. However, if
there's anything you're curious about, ask in the lobby. Not only is
it likely that someone will answer, but your question and its answer
may well make it into this manual and help someone else.
