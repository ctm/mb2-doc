# Poker, with your friends

Mb2 is poker software with a nice friendly player base.

Mb2 is in an early stage of development.  The server is world-class,
full-featured and state-of-the art.  However, the user interface is currently
mostly unstyled.

The server improves almost every day. The styling of the user interface has
slipped repeatedly, but has not been forgotten nor is it being ignored.

### Read no further, Try the [Demo](https://craftpoker.com)

Although ugly, the user interface is _mostly_ self explanatory.  As
such, you can try the [demo](https://craftpoker.com) and only come back to
this document if you're curious.

There's more information about the demo on the next page of this book.

### Come back for the tournaments

Although you can create your own tournaments and have them start
whenever you want, at least two tournaments are typically scheduled
each day.

From May 30th, 2023 through July 18th,
[craftpoker.com](https://craftpoker.com) hosts one
[WSOP-style](series/2023/wsop-style.md) tournament each day, and the
winner gets to choose either an [Engraved Rectangular Glass
Paperweight](https://www.trophies2go.com/engraved-rettangolo-glass-paperweight.html)
or $50 cash (via Venmo or Zelle).

This WSOP-Style tournament starts each day at:

* Monday through Friday: 5pm Pacific time (8pm Eastern)
* Saturday and Sunday: 3pm Pacific time (6pm Eastern)

The other tournaments that are run only have bragging rights as a
prize, although the winner does get the privilege to pick the
structure for the same tournament on the next day (e.g., the winner of
the night tournament chooses the structure for the night tournament
the next day).

The night tournament starts at 8pm Pacific. 

On Saturday and Sunday there may be an evening tournament at 5pm Pacific.

So, figure out what time they start in your time zone and join us.

### This manual is&hellip; Player Driven

Maintaining this documentation is currently, low-priority.

The regular players already know most of the information herein and
"outsiders" become insiders simply by joining and playing. However, if
there's anything you're curious about, ask in the lobby. Not only is
it likely that someone will answer, but your question and its answer
may well make it into this manual and help someone else.
