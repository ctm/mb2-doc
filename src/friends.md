# Poker, with your friends

Mb2 is poker software with a nice friendly user base.

Mb2 is in an early stage of development.  The server itself is world-class,
full-featured, state-of-the art.  However&hellip;

The user interface is currently rough and this documentation is
rougher.  The server improves almost every day, the user interface gets
minor improvements every now and again.  This book, however, hasn't been
touched in a very long time, because the user interface will be completely
rewritten and documenting the current interface is a distraction.

So, check out the server and use the horrible interface to play with
great people.  Someday you can look back wistfully when you're playing
on a great interface with horrible people...
