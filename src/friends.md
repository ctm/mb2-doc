# Poker, with your friends

Mb2 is poker software with a nice friendly user base.

Mb2 is in an early stage of development.  The server itself is world-class,
full-featured, state-of-the art.  However&hellip;

The user interface is currently unstyled.  The server improves almost
every day. The user interface will be styled in the first quarter of
2022.

Although ugly, the user interface is _mostly_ self explanatory.  As
such, you can read the following page (click on the > at the right of
this page or the word [Demo](demo.html) in the index on the left), try
the demo and only come back to this document when you want to read
about the portions that aren't self-explanatory.

Currently two tournaments are scheduled every day, the evening
tournament begins at 5pm Pacific and the night tournament at 8pm
Pacific.  So, figure out what time they start in your time zone and
join us. For now you'll be using the horrible interface to play with
great people.  Someday you can look back wistfully when you're playing
on a great interface with horrible people...
