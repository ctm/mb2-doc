# Shareable URLs

When you are at a table, the URL in the location portion of your
table's windowframe is a URL that you can share with people.  People
who visit the URL can watch the game (if there's still something to
watch).

For example, the URL
[https://craftpoker.com/event/3076/player/10](https://craftpoker.com/event/3076/player/10)
was from a tournament on February 22nd, 2022. Specifically, that was
deadhead's (player #10) URL. The tournament started at 5:05 Pacific
and deadhead bust at 6:15 Pacific, so if anyone had visited that URL
between when the tournament started and when deadhead bust, that
person would have seen the game playing in real time.

If a URL includes a player, then it is player-specific and the
observer will automatically follow the player if the player is
assigned to a different table.

If a URL is visited after the player has bust or won, a summary of the
event will be displayed. E.g.,

![Deadhead Bust](./deadhead-fsatg.png "Deadhead is not good at this game")
