# Advanced Checkboxes

In general, checkboxes are used to select choices before it's your turn to
act.  If you have bad cards and you know you're going to fold when it
is your turn, you can click on a `Fold` checkbox. If you change your mind
before it becomes your turn you can simply uncheck the checkbox.

Many of the checkboxes act like "radio buttons" do in other interfaces. If
you check `Fold` and then check `Call Any`, the `Fold` checkbox will
automatically be unchecked.
