# Omaha X Or Better

Omaha X Or Better is like
[Binglaha](https://www.ceemeck.org/BARGERuleBook2021/TournGames.html#binglaha),
except two dice are rolled.  So, each hand, after the flop betting, 2
dice are rolled and their sum determines whether it's high only or
high/low split and if it's the latter, what qualifier is needed for the low.
There is never a qualifier for high.

|Sum|Split?|Low Qualifier|
|---|------|---------|
|2|High Only||
|3|High Only||
|4|High Only||
|5|High/Low|Wheel Only|
|6|High/Low|6 or Better|
|7|High/Low|7 or Better|
|8|High/Low|8 or Better|
|9|High/Low|9 or Better|
|10|High/Low|10 or Better|
|11|High/Low|Jack or Better|
|12|High/Low|Queen or Better|
