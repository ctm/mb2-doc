# Dealer's Choice

Twenty-one different games are offered in Dealer's Choice.  Initially,
the first player in or past seat one chooses the game.  That game is
then played for six hands, and then the player in the next seat gets
to choose.  Currently there is no representation (i.e., neither
textual nor visual) of who is going to get to choose next.
