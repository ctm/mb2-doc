# Dealer's Choice

## Coming "Soon"

Dealer's Choice is not fully implemented, but it is present in the structures:
* "WSOP 2023"-style [#05 Dealer's Choice](https://www.wsop.com/pdfs/structuresheets/structure_5219_21670.pdf)
* "WSOP 2023"-style [#10 Dealer's Choice](https://www.wsop.com/pdfs/structuresheets/structure_5219_21675.pdf)

which will be dealt as part of the [WSOPS 2023
Series](../series/2023/wsop-style.md#the-tournaments) on July 5th ad July
6th.

Twenty-one different games are offered in Dealer's Choice, however,
**the incomplete implementation doesn't actually allow anyone to
choose the games**. Instead, each of the twenty-one games are dealt
six times in rotation.

By July 1st, there will be a picker, and each player in rotation will
be allowed to pick the game for the next six hands.
