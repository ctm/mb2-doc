# Crayfish Omaha or Hold'em

Omaha and Hold'em and most variants thereof can be played "crayfish
style", where all five cards of the board are dealt on the flop, with
both the turn and river being the roll of a die.  If the die roll is a
one, the first card of the board is turned face down (or left face
down if it has already been turned that way) and is no longer
available to make a hand. A rolled two, similarly invalidates the
second card, etc. A roll of a six does not affect the board.

Other than those changes to the flop, turn and river, the rest of the
game is played the same.
