# Dealer's Die

Dealer's Die is like [Dealer's Choice](dealers-choice.md), but instead of the twenty-one
poker games available in the World Series of Poker Dealer's Choice
tournaments, thirteen obscure poker games&mdash;each requiring the
roll of one or more die&mdash;are the available to be chosen.

All games are played pot-limit.

Initially, the first player in or past seat one chooses the game.
That game is then played for six hands, and then the player in the
next seat gets to choose.  Currently the user interface provides no
representation (i.e., neither textual nor visual) of who is going to
get to choose next.

You do not need to know the number to choose a game.  The choice is
made from a menu, and the numbering just reflects the order of the
choices in the menu.
