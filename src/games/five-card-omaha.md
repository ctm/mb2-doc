# Five Card Omaha

It's what you'd think: [Omaha High
Only](https://secure.barge.org/bargerulebooks/BARGERuleBook2021-20210712.pdf#page=20),
but with five hole cards instead of
four.  It's high only[^1].

Like regular Omaha High, at the showdown, each player must use exactly
two hole cards and three from the board.  It is typically played Pot-Limit,
but can also be played Fixed-Limit or No-Limit.

called [Big
