# Redrum

Redrum is
[Murder](https://www.ceemeck.org/BARGERuleBook2021/other.html#murder)
where the low is deuce-to-seven style and there's no qualifier but the
high has a Full House of Fives or higher qualifier.  Its origins are
unclear, but there was probably drinking involved.


Redrum is not well play-balanced.  It is either a failed experiment or
a stalled experiment.  Perhaps the rules will be tweaked in the future
to make it fun.
