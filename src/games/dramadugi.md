# Dramadugi

## Single Draw Dramaha but with 4-card Badugi

Dramadugi is a single-draw split game that is similar to
[Dramaha](https://secure.barge.org/bargerulebooks/BARGERuleBook2021-20210712.pdf#page=42). One
difference is that at the showdown, the half of the pot that would go
to the best five card hand in Dramaha is instead given to the best
four card Badugi that uses four of the player's five hole cards.  The other
difference is that **at most three cards** can be exchanged during
the draw, not five.


The following is how a page to the BARGE Rule Book could be added.

### Forced Money

The game is played with a button and blinds. It can be played fixed-limit,
pot-limit or no-limit.

### Dealing Procedure

Each player is dealt five cards face down, followed by a round of
betting.  Three community cards are placed face
up. This is followed by a round of betting.
Then each player in turn discards zero to three cards from their
hand. Once all of the discards have been announced, the dealer will
deal each player an appropriate number of replacement cards. Note that
this differs from Triple Draw Dramaha, where the draw takes place
**before** the flop betting.  One additional community card is placed face
up. This is followed by a round of betting.  One
additional community card is placed face up. This is followed by the final
round of betting. This is followed by a showdown.

When played fixed-limit, the first two betting rounds (pre-flop and
post-flop) are done at the small bet limit and the final two rounds
(post-turn and post-river) are done at the large bet limit.

### Evaluating the Showdown 

The best Omaha high hand (using exactly two cards from the playerâ€™s hand and
exactly three cards from the board) and the best four card Badugi hand (with
each of the four cards coming from the player's hole cards) splits the pot.

The fifth card is not a tie-breaker. A234 rainbow with the fifth card being
a K would split a pot with A234 rainbow with a five as the fifth card.
