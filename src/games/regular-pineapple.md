[Crazy Pineapple High/Low Eight-or-Better](https://www.ceemeck.org/BARGERuleBook2021/TournGames.html#crazy-pineapple-highlow-eight-or-better)
except the discard happens before the flop is dealt.

So, in Regular Pineapple, each player gets three cards and then
there's a round of betting. After that betting round, each player
discards a single card. After that, the flop is dealt and there's
another betting round. Then the turn is dealt and there's betting
round, followed by the river being dealt and the final betting round.
