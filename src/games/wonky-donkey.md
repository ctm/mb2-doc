# Wonky Donkey

Wonky Donkey is either Hold'em or Omaha/8, but which one it is isn't
known until after the flop.  Each player gets dealt two face-down
hole cards and then there's a betting round. After that, a three card
flop is dealt.

If two or three of the flop cards are <span
style="color:red">red</span>, the game proceeds as Hold'em.

If two or three of the flop cards are **black**, each payer is dealt
two additional face-down hole cards (before the post-flop betting
begins) and the game proceeds as Omaha Hi/Low Split with an Eight
Qualifier.
