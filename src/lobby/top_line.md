# Top Line

### Your Nickname

At the top of the lobby you're told your nickname (e.g., `â˜•
deadhead`). That can be useful if you want to see how you've
customized your nickname (e.g., with capitalization, punctuation,
white-space or emojis).

Immediately to the right is a drop-down menu that allows you to see
some reports (currently the net profit leaderboards and recent
tournaments).

### Leaderboards

By default, the net profit leaderboards only show
players who have won more Fun Money in payouts than they've paid in
buy-ins. However, if you have a non-positive balance and you want to
see it, you can hold down the shift key when you click one of the
leaderboard menu items.  If you hold the shift key down when you click
and you don't see your nick, then no tournaments have finished that
you were entered in.

### Recent Tournaments

Recent Tournaments brings up a list of the non-demo/non-test
tournaments that have finished in the last month.

Each row contains the starting date and time of the tournament, the
Fun Money buy-in, the number of entrants and the name of the Event.
If you click on a row, the results from that tournament are displayed.

#### Bragging (or crying) Rights

When you bring up the results of a specific tournament, there is a
little icon to the right of the name of that tournament. It looks like
a couple of (three if you count the sideways one) links in a chain. If
you click on that icon, the URL for this result will be copied to the
pasteboard which can then be pasted into email, twitter or some other
messaging system.

Here's an example: [https://devctm.com/event/3083/player/10](https://devctm.com/event/3083/player/10)

### Rules

Beyond that is a drop-down menu to the rules for almost all the games
Mb2 knows how to deal.  Action Razzdugi does not currently have an
entry, but it's just like Razzdugi, except the Razz half is Action
Razz.

### Audio

The next item is a bell, which allows you to mute the gong. The gong
is rung when a new tournament is added.  That alerts people to the
presence of the new tournament so they can sign up. If your bell is
green, the gong will be played. If gray, it won't.  If you hover
your mouse over the bell, it will tell you its status.

Two daily tournaments (the 5:05pm Pacific and 8:10pm Pacific) have the
tradition of encouraging the winner to pick the following day's
tournament. It's viscerally satisfying to win, create the successor
tournament and then [bang a
gong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4o4Q9sd_y4).

# Preferences

If you are logged in to a non-demo account, your final icon will be
what looks like three horizontal sliders. Clicking it allows you to
set [preferences](./preferences.html) that are remembered
indefinitely.
