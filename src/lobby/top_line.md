# Top Line

At the top of the lobby you're told your nickname (e.g., `â˜•
deadhead`). That can be useful if you want to see how you've
customized your nickname (e.g., with capitalization, punctuation,
whitespace or emojis).

Immediately to the right is a drop-down menu that allows you to see
some reports (at minimum the net profit leaderboard and the recent
tournaments).

The final item is a bell, which allows you to mute the gong. The gong
is rung when a new tournament is added.  That alerts people to the
presence of the new tournament so they can sign up. If your bell is
green, the gong will be played. If gray, it won't.  If you hover
your mouse over the bell, it will tell you its status.

Two daily tournaments (the 5:05pm PDT and 8:10pm PDT) have the
tradition of encouraging the winner to pick the following day's
tournament. It's viscerally satisfying to win, create the successor
tournament and then [bang a
