# Games

Mb2 can deal around fifty different variations of poker. This includes
common ones like Texas Hold'em, Omaha and Seven Card Stud as well as
lesser known games like Badugi, Courchevel and Big O.

The [BARGE Rule Book](http://www.ceemeck.org/BARGERuleBook2021/) has
rules to all but two of the games mb2 deals.  The exceptions are
Mexican Poker and Redrum.
