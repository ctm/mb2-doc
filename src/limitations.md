# Limitations

There are far too many limitations in the current UI to list them here. As
such, the only limitation that I'm listing is one that caught me by surprise
and was initially labeled as a [bug](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/labels/bug).

## Some icons don't show up on iPhones

Ugly as it may be, all the functionality of the UI is available on
"full sized" devices (e.g., computer monitors with a modern
resolution). However, on iPhones some functionality is actually
missing, specifically there's [no create event icon, nor is there a
down chevron](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues/300).  Since the
current UI is going away, I decided to document that limitation rather
than have it persist as a bug in mb2's [issue
tracker](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues).
