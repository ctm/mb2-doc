# Demo

There's a button labeled `Demo` on
[https://devctm.com](https://devctm.com "Pre-alpha")

Go to the site, click that `Demo` button, and you'll be logged into a
demo [account](./accounts.md) and be placed in the
[lobby](./lobby.md).  At the bottom of the lobby chat will be
instructions in red telling you to click the `Start` button to start a
2-player No-Limit Texas Hold'em tournament.

### To Demo Something other than 2 Player Texas Hold'em

If you visit the site and hold the `shift` key down when you click
`Demo`, you'll be able to choose more than 2 players and
[games](./games.md) (technically [structures](./structures.md)) other
than No Limit Hold'em.

### Demo Limitations

Demo accounts are able to chat with non-demo accounts, but are not
allowed to join events that require a buy-in (the events that don't
require buy-ins are demo events and testing events).

You are not able to change preferences of a demo account.

So, after you've played with the demo, you may want to create your own account.
