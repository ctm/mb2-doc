# Demo

There's a button labeled `Demo` on
[https://devctm.com](https://devctm.com "Pre-alpha")

Go to the site, click that button, and you'll be told to type `start`
in the chat box to start a 2-player No-Limit Texas Hold'em tournament.

If you have the `shift` key down when you click `Demo`, you'll be able
to choose more than 2 players and [games](./games.md) (technically
[structures](./structures.md)) other than No Limit Hold'em.

Using the demo, you'll start in the [lobby](./lobby.md), with a demo
[account](./accounts.md). Demo accounts are able to chat with non-demo
accounts in the lobby, but are not allowed to join non-demo events.
So, after you've played with the demo a little, you may want to create
an user account.
