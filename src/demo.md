# Demo

There's a button labeled `Demo` on
[https://devctm.com](https://devctm.com "Pre-alpha")

Go to the site, click that `Demo` button, and you'll be presented with
a modal dialog.  

### Default Values

If you click the `CREATE` button without changing any of the values in
that dialog, you'll get a 2-player No-Limit Texas Hold'em tournament
whose structure is based on the 2022 World Series of Poker Main Event.

You'll then be logged into a demo [account](./accounts.md) and be
placed in the [lobby](./lobby.md).  At the bottom of the lobby chat
will be instructions in red telling you to click the `Start` button to
start the tournament you just created.

When you click `Start`, your browser will attempt to open two pop-up
windows, one for each player.  If a pop-up blocker prevents the windows
from being opened, you'll told how to proceed.

### To Demo Something other than 2 Player Texas Hold'em

If you'd rather explore something else, you can see other
[games](./games.md) by choosing a different
[structure](./structures.md).

### Demo Limitations

Demo accounts are able to chat with non-demo accounts, but are not
allowed to join events that require a buy-in (the events that don't
require buy-ins are demo events and testing events).

You are not able to change preferences of a demo account.

So, after you've played with the demo, you may want to create your own account.
