# Demo

There's a button labeled `Demo` on
[https://devctm.com](https://devctm.com "Pre-alpha")

Go to the site, click that button, and you'll be told to type `start`
in the chat box to start a 2-player No-Limit Texas Hold'em tournament.

If you have the `shift` key down when you click `Demo`, you'll be able
to choose more than 2 players and [games](./games.md) (technically
[structures](./structures.md)) other than No Limit Hold'em.

Wen you click `Demo`, you'll be logged into a demo [account](./accounts.md)
and be paced in the [lobby](./lobby.md).

Demo accounts are able to chat with non-demo accounts, but are not
allowed to join events that require a buy-in (the events that don't
require buy-ins are demo events and testing events).  So, after you've
played with the demo, you may want to create a user account.
