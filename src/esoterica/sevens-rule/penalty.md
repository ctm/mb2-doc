# Penalty

## Sevens Rule Penalty

The penalty is:

> After violating the Sevens Rule, further action from that player,
> for the remainder of that hand, will be lost or returned. It will
> never increase the amount to be won above the amount to be won
> pre-violation.

If a player checks a seven and subsequently folds or loses the hand,
there is no penalty, because that player would not win anything
anyway.

However, if a player checks a seven, post-draw, and shows the best
hand, all of that player's post-check action is returned to the
player.

Furthermore, if no other hand tied the best hand shown by the
violator, then everyone's action beyond that check, from any pot that
includes that hand, is returned.

If there is a tie between one or more Sevens Rule violators and one or
more Sevens Rule followers, the post-draw action of the Sevens Rule
violators is returned to the violators and the remaining amount in the
pot is awarded to the non-violator (or split evenly if more than one
non-violator has a tying winning hand).
