# GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/about) is a wonderful service for
programmers, but if you don't already know what it is, you _probably_
don't want to join it just to use your GitHub account to log in to
Mb2, but you can if you want.

Mb2 currently supports signing-on (and signing-up) via GitHub as a
proof-of-concept for allowing logging in through social media.  GitHub
was chosen to be first because Mb2's user interface currently is
"sub-optimal" (`/me chuckles`) and as such the next tranche to be
exposed to Mb2 are likely to be people who can look beyond the
surface, e.g., programmers.

If you sign-in via GitHub, your account's canonical name will be your
GitHub account's name canonicalized. You can customize your nickname by
putting the customization in the `Nickname` field of the sign-up and then
clicking the `Login with GitHub` button. Your customization will only
be accepted if it is compatible with your canonicalized name.

As an example of customization, if your GitHub account name is `ctm` and
you put `Ctm!` in the `Nickname` field, then when you're logged in, your
nickname will be `Ctm!`. If, however, you put `deadhead` in the `Nickname`
field, then your nickname will simply be the unadorned `ctm`.

FWIW, GitHub hosts the [source to this Player's
Manual](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/tree/master/src), this Player's
Manual itself, [Mb2's issue
tracker](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues) and the source to mb2
(in a private repository).
