# Sevens Rule

## Sevens Rule Definition

The Sevens Rule applies only to California Lowball. It is simply:

> After the draw, if you have a seven or better, you may not check it.

For the purposes of the Sevens Rule, calling an amount that is less
than the post-draw bet size is considered a check. The only way that
can happen is if the first player to bet goes all-in for less than the
post-draw bet size.
