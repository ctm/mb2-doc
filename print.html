<p>Mb2 is poker software with a nice friendly user base.</p>
<p>Mb2 is in an early stage of development.  The server itself is world-class,
full-featured, state-of-the art.  However…</p>
<p>The user interface is currently rough and this documentation is
rougher.  Both improve every day, so if you don't like what you see
now, come back tomorrow, … or wait a week and see even greater
improvement.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#demo" id="demo">Demo</a></h1>
<p>There's a button labeled <code>Demo</code> on
<a href="https://devctm.com" title="Pre-alpha">https://devctm.com</a></p>
<p>Go to the site, click that button, and you'll be told to type <code>start</code>
in the chat box to start a 2-player No-Limit Texas Hold'em tournament.</p>
<p>If you have the <code>shift</code> key down when you click <code>Demo</code>, you'll be able
to choose more than 2 players and <a href="./games.html">games</a> (technically
<a href="./structures.html">structures</a>) other than No Limit Hold'em.</p>
<p>Using the demo, you'll start in the <a href="./lobby.html">lobby</a>, with a demo
<a href="./accounts.html">account</a>. Demo accounts are able to chat with non-demo
accounts in the lobby, but are not allowed to join non-demo events.
So, after you've played with the demo a little, you may want to create
an user account.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#accounts" id="accounts">Accounts</a></h1>
<p>Accounts are free.</p>
<p>You may create more than one, but please don't mislead.</p>
<p>Currently, no email account is associated with an account. Mb2's
purpose is to provide fun, not to sell you things or collect your
information. Mb2 currently doesn't even use cookies, nor does it
record your IP address.</p>
<p>Your password is never stored in a database. Instead, a hash of your
password is stored. That means there's no way for anyone associated
with mb2 to recover your password.  Since mb2 doesn't use email
addresses, the only way to have your password reset is to ask (e.g.,
via chat or email).  So, when you create an account, please remember
or write down your password.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#lobby" id="lobby">Lobby</a></h1>
<p>After you sign in, you'll be in the lobby, where you can see the active
tables, a list of upcoming tournaments and recent chat.</p>
<p><img src="./lobby.png" alt="Lobby" title="Lobby" /></p>
<p>The first line in the lobby is the nickname you've logged in as.  You may
have more than one nickname, but please don't use multiple nicknames to
mislead, collude or dump chips.</p>
<p>The second line lists the others logged in.</p>
<p>If any tables are active, each gets a row with the table id and a list
of the players at that table.  The table id itself is a link.  If you
click on it, you'll get a pop-up that allows you to observe that table.</p>
<p>Any upcoming tournaments that you're allowed to join are then
listed. To join, click the check-box.  If you change your mind, before
the tournament starts, just click the check-box again.</p>
<p>When you join a tournament there may be esoteric options that you can
choose via a pull-down in the right most column.  They should be
self-explanatory.  Above that column is the little white plus sign
that brings up the tournament creation modal dialog (see below).</p>
<p>The column labeled <code>#</code> is the number of players currently signed up.  If
you want to see which players are signed up, bring your cursor over that
number and the entrants' nicknames will be revealed.</p>
<p>The starting time is in the timezone that your browser is configured
to display.  That's normally the timezone you're in, but check the
three letter timezone abbreviation to be sure.</p>
<p>A synopsis of the tournament structure is in the <code>Tournament</code> column.
If you bring your cursor over the synopsis, more details will drop
down.</p>
<p>The rest of the lobby is chat and a box for you to enter chat.  All
chat is logged, however, currently only chat that occurs after you
sign in will be displayed.  That's pretty poor behavior and will be
improved.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#creation-of-a-new-tournament" id="creation-of-a-new-tournament">Creation of a new tournament</a></h3>
<p>If you click on the white plus small icon, you get the following dialog:</p>
<p><img src="./create-tournament.png" alt="Create Tournament" title="Create Tournament" /></p>
<p>The Structure attribute is a pull-down menu from one of approximately
50 pre-existing tournament structures.  Currently you can not create your
own structure, although traditionally the winner of the 5pm PDT tournament
gets to pick the following day's tournaments and may request a new
structure.</p>
<p>Tournaments that are created for testing or demo purposes should be
Free, since free tournaments don't affect anyone's standings.
Tournaments where people are expected to play well should probably
have a 100 buy-in if for no other reason than to make it clear that
the participants will be taking the tournament seriously.</p>
<p>Adding a comment is optional.  If you add a comment, it will show up
when people hover over the tournament structure in the listing of
upcoming tournaments.</p>
<p>Start At is in the same timezone as upcoming tournaments are displayed in.
That's whatever your browser thinks your timezone is.  The first time
you bring up the &quot;Add a Tournament&quot; dialog, &quot;Start At&quot; is pre-populated
with a value that is ten minutes into the future.  However, after that,
the dialog simply remembers whatever value was in that field previously.</p>
<p>Round Duration (Minutes) is in essence a scaling factor.  In most
tournaments, all rounds are the same length.  When create a new tournament
and specify the round duration, what you're <em>really</em> doing is saying how
long you want the first round to be.  If any rounds have a different duration
from the duration of the first round, they'll be scaled.</p>
<p>So, if there's a structure where the odd numbered rounds are 20 minutes
and the even numbered rounds are 30 minutes, if you specify Round
Duration as 5 minutes, then you'll have a tournament where the odd
numbered rounds are 5 minutes and the even ones are 7.5 minutes.</p>
<p>The TOC (Tournament of Champions) style format has a 15 minute Hold'em
first round, an 18 minute Stud second round and a 22 minute Omaha/8
third round.  So, if &quot;Round Duration (Minutes)&quot; is set to 5, then the
second round will be 6 minutes and the third round will be seven
minutes, twenty seconds long.</p>
<p>For a dozen or so players, five minute rounds for most structures results
in a tournament that finishes in about an hour and a half.</p>
<p>Seconds to Act is how much time a player gets to act before being sent
to vacation.  No, 999 is not a reasonable number of &quot;Seconds to Act&quot;.
Typically we use 45 there and that's the default when this dialog comes
up.</p>
<p>A player may call time to get more time to act.  There currently is no
limit on how many times a player can call time.  Calling time resets
the number of seconds to act (it does <em>not</em> add to the number of
seconds to act).  So, if &quot;Seconds to Act after calling Time&quot; is set to
60, calling time will mean that the player must act within 60 seconds
regardless of how much time to act the player had remaining.</p>
<p>Schedules have breaks built into them, and like Round Duration, they
scale based on the same ration of the &quot;Round Duration (Minutes)&quot;
setting to the duration of the first level in the structure.  That can
result in breaks that would be too short were it not for the &quot;Minimum
Break Duration in Minutes&quot; setting.  However, the duration of a break
is like the duration of a round in that it can start in the middle of
a hand. The players who are still in the hand still need to finish the
hand.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#top-line" id="top-line">Top Line</a></h1>
<p>At the top of the lobby you're told your nickname (e.g., <code>☕ deadhead</code>). That can be useful if you want to see how you've
customized your nickname (e.g., with capitalization, punctuation,
white-space or emojis).</p>
<p>Immediately to the right is a drop-down menu that allows you to see
some reports (at minimum the net profit leaderboard and the recent
tournaments).</p>
<p>Beyond that is a drop-down menu to the rules for all the games Mb2
knows how to deal.</p>
<p>The final item is a bell, which allows you to mute the gong. The gong
is rung when a new tournament is added.  That alerts people to the
presence of the new tournament so they can sign up. If your bell is
green, the gong will be played. If gray, it won't.  If you hover
your mouse over the bell, it will tell you its status.</p>
<p>Two daily tournaments (the 5:05pm PDT and 8:10pm PDT) have the
tradition of encouraging the winner to pick the following day's
tournament. It's viscerally satisfying to win, create the successor
tournament and then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4o4Q9sd_y4">bang a
gong</a>.</p>

<p>Mb2 can deal around fifty different variations of poker. This includes
common ones like Texas Hold'em, Omaha and Seven Card Stud as well as
lesser known games like Badugi, Courchevel and Big O.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#structures" id="structures">Structures</a></h1>
<h1><a class="header" href="#lammers" id="lammers">Lammers</a></h1>
<p>Some of the tournament structures (typically limited to big-bet)
include lammers in addition to starting chips.  Each lammer is worth a
fixed amount and can be used in four different ways:</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#redemption-before-the-first-hand" id="redemption-before-the-first-hand">Redemption Before the First Hand</a></h3>
<p>If you want to redeem any of your lammers before the first hand, you
must use the &quot;extra options&quot; menu from the lobby that's the rightmost
column in the upcoming tournaments area.  The leftmost column is the
check-box that you use to join.  The rightmost column is a down
chevron that has a drop-down menu associated with it.  When a
tournament uses lammers, that drop-down allows you to specify how many
of the lammers you want to redeem before the start of the first hand.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#manual-redemption-during-the-game" id="manual-redemption-during-the-game">Manual Redemption During The Game</a></h3>
<p>The redeem command (requires use of the command text box) takes a
single numeric argument that specifies how many lammers you wish to
redeem (e.g., <code>redeem 2</code>).</p>
<p>If you are in a hand, the redemption will happen at the end of that
hand.  If you have a redemption scheduled for the end of the hand and
you change your mind you can use <code>redeem 0</code>.</p>
<p>If you're not in a hand, the redemption will happen immediately and can
not be reverted.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#resurrection" id="resurrection">Resurrection</a></h3>
<p>If you bust and you have one or more lammers left, exactly one lammer
will be cashed in and you'll be back in the game with the amount of
chips that lammer is worth.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#forced-redemption" id="forced-redemption">Forced Redemption</a></h3>
<p>Typically there's a final level where lammers are allowed and if you
finish that level, all lammers you have are redeemed for you (and all
your opponents) automatically.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#esoterica" id="esoterica">Esoterica</a></h1>
<h1><a class="header" href="#sevens-rule" id="sevens-rule">Sevens Rule</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#sevens-rule-definition" id="sevens-rule-definition">Sevens Rule Definition</a></h2>
<p>The Sevens Rule applies only to California Lowball. It is simply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the draw, if you have a seven or better, you may not check it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the purposes of the Sevens Rule, calling an amount that is less
than the post-draw bet size is considered a check. The only way that
can happen is if the first player to bet goes all-in for less than the
post-draw bet size.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#penalty" id="penalty">Penalty</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#sevens-rule-penalty" id="sevens-rule-penalty">Sevens Rule Penalty</a></h2>
<p>The penalty itself is simple, too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After violating the Sevens Rule, a player will not win any more from further action in that hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a player checks a seven and subsequently folds or loses the hand,
there is no penalty, because that player would not win anything
anyway.</p>
<p>However, if a player checks a seven, post-draw, and shows the best
hand, all of that player's post-check action is returned to the
player.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if no other hand tied the best hand shown by the
violator, then everyone's action beyond that check, from any pot that
includes that hand, is returned.</p>
<p>If there is a tie between one or more Sevens Rule violators and one or
more Sevens Rule followers, the post-draw action of the Sevens Rule
violators is returned to the violators and the remaining amount in the
pot is awarded to the non-violator (or split evenly if more than one
non-violator has a tying winning hand).</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#example" id="example">Example</a></h1>
<p>The BARGE Rule Book has an <a href="http://www.ceemeck.org/BARGERuleBook2020/the-sevens-rule.html">elaborate
example</a>.
It's worth reading.</p>
<p>The following page of this Players' Manual has a simplistic example,
but shows what the output looks like in the scrolling text portion of
the the table.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#mb2-text" id="mb2-text">Mb2 Text</a></h1>
<p>Mb2 automatically awards the right amount of chips to players in a
hand where the Sevens Rule is violated. However, since action is
collected prior to the showdown, the transfer of chips at the showdown
can look like players are winning chips, in a separate pot, when their
own action is returned.</p>
<p>In a simple case where the case where a sevens rule violator wins the
pot, the text output might look something like:</p>
<pre><code>deadhead  2s 6c 3d Qc 5c  Queen (Q 6 5 3 2) Qc 6c 5c 3d 2s
tombayz  Mucks
gerdog  7s 3h 4s Ah 6h  Seven (7 6 4 3 A) 7s 6h 4s 3h Ah
1: deadhead wins 300
1: tombayz wins 300
1: gerdog wins 300
M: gerdog wins 900
The above includes penalties:
gerdog didn't bet a Seven (7 6 4 3 A)
So, these adjustments were made:
deadhead took back 300
tombayz took back 300
gerdog took back 300
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, the way Mb2 <em>currently</em> works is chips are internally
awarded based on who has the best hand, <em>before</em> the Sevens Rule is
enforced. So, in the rare case where a violator of the Sevens Rule and
a non-violator both tie with the winning hand, in addition to a
&quot;took back&quot; line, there will also be a &quot;recovered misawarded&quot; line
that shows the difference between what would have been awarded when
the pot was split and the amount that was actually returned.</p>
<p>Although the correct amounts are awarded, there's plenty of room for
improvement in terms of what is displayed. Perhaps sometime in the
future it will be improved, although it's low priority.</p>
