<p>Mb2 is poker software with a nice friendly user base.</p>
<p>Mb2 is in an early stage of development.  The server itself is world-class,
full-featured, state-of-the art.  However…</p>
<p>The user interface is currently rough and this documentation is
rougher.  The server improves almost every day; the user interface gets
minor improvements every now and again.  This book, however, hasn't been
touched in a very long time, because the user interface will be completely
rewritten and documenting the current interface is a distraction.</p>
<p>So, read the following page (click on the &gt; at the right of this page
or the word <a href="demo.html">Demo</a> in the index on the left) and try the
demo.  Then, at 5pm Pacific or 8pm Pacific, use the horrible interface
to play with great people.  Someday you can look back wistfully when
you're playing on a great interface with horrible people...</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#demo" id="demo">Demo</a></h1>
<p>There's a button labeled <code>Demo</code> on
<a href="https://devctm.com" title="Pre-alpha">https://devctm.com</a></p>
<p>Go to the site, click that button, and you'll be told to type <code>start</code>
in the chat box to start a 2-player No-Limit Texas Hold'em tournament.</p>
<p>If you have the <code>shift</code> key down when you click <code>Demo</code>, you'll be able
to choose more than 2 players and <a href="./games.html">games</a> (technically
<a href="./structures.html">structures</a>) other than No Limit Hold'em.</p>
<p>Using the demo, you'll start in the <a href="./lobby.html">lobby</a>, with a demo
<a href="./accounts.html">account</a>. Demo accounts are able to chat with non-demo
accounts in the lobby, but are not allowed to join events that require
a buy-in (the events that don't require buy-ins are demo events and
testing events).  So, after you've played with the demo a little, you
may want to create a user account.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#accounts" id="accounts">Accounts</a></h1>
<p>Accounts are free.</p>
<p>You may create more than one, but please don't mislead.</p>
<p>Currently, no email account is associated with an account. Mb2's
purpose is to provide fun, not to sell you things or collect your
information. Mb2 currently doesn't even use cookies, nor does it
record your IP address.</p>
<p>Your password is never stored in a database. Instead, a hash of your
password is stored. That means there's no way for anyone associated
with mb2 to recover your password.  Since mb2 doesn't use email
addresses, the only way to have your password reset is to ask (e.g.,
via chat or email).  So, when you create an account, please remember
or write down your password.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#privacy" id="privacy">Privacy</a></h1>
<p>At the time this page was written, every detail was correct.  However,
while mb2 is still under rapid deployment, there's a chance that some
of the information on this page may inadvertently become outdated.  As
such, don't bet your life—or anyone else's—that the
information here is correct.</p>
<p>Everyone's privacy is important to the developers of mb2. As such, mb2
does not use cookies.  Mb2 does, however, use your browser's session
storage and local storage to keep track of your being logged in and
connected to tables.  As such, were your computer forensically
examined, it may be possible to tell that you've been connected to mb2.</p>
<p>Mb2 logs almost all traffic between the client and the server. These
logs are used for debugging and are currently retained forever.  Mb2
uses Cloudflare as a content delivery network, but the WebSockets that
connect your lobby and table pages to the server do not run through
Cloudflare. Mb2 currently runs on AWS (Amazon Web Services). The
initial connection to mb2 runs through an AWS Application Load
Balancer (ALB) which decrypts the HTTPS connection initially made, but
the WebSockets themselves (through which your password is transferred)
do not go through an ALB and as such the WSS encrypted traffic is
decoded on the AWS instance running mb2.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#security" id="security">Security</a></h1>
<p>Some of mb2's <a href="./privacy.html">privacy</a> features also provide a modicum
of security. Specifically, your password and all of your actions are
encrypted by your web browser and decrypted only inside mb2.
Similarly, your hole cards are encrypted by mb2 and only decrypted by
your browser.</p>
<p>Although mb2 logs your actions and your hole (or other down) cards,
those logs remain in mb2's memory until the hand is over. Only after
the hand has finished is that information logged to mb2's database.
Mb2 uses an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL Database instance that is encrypted
at rest.  Mb2 communicates with its database using SSL.</p>
<p>Your password is never stored.  Instead, a hash of your password is
stored.  That is sufficient for mb2 to be able to tell if you have
provided your password when you sign in. However, your password can
never be recovered, although it can be reset.</p>
<p>During development, mb2 uses
<a href="https://rust-random.github.io/book/guide-rngs.html?highlight=thread_rng#our-rngs"><code>thread_rng</code></a>
from the <a href="https://docs.rs/rand/0.8.3/rand/">rand crate</a> (crates are
essentially Rust libraries. Rust is the language mb2 is written
in). The authors of <code>thread_rng</code> believe it to be <a href="https://rust-random.github.io/book/guide-gen.html#cryptographically-secure-pseudo-random-number-generator">cryptographically
secure</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#lobby" id="lobby">Lobby</a></h1>
<p>After you sign in, you'll be in the lobby, where you can see the active
tables, a list of upcoming tournaments and recent chat.</p>
<p><img src="./lobby.png" alt="Lobby" title="Lobby" /></p>
<p>The first line in the lobby is the nickname you've logged in as.  You may
have more than one nickname, but please don't use multiple nicknames to
mislead, collude or dump chips.</p>
<p>The second line lists the others logged in.</p>
<p>If any tables are active, each gets a row with the table id and a list
of the players at that table.  The table id itself is a link.  If you
click on it, you'll get a pop-up that allows you to observe that table.</p>
<p>Any upcoming tournaments that you're allowed to join are then
listed. To join, click the check-box.  If you change your mind, before
the tournament starts, just click the check-box again.</p>
<p>When you join a tournament there may be esoteric options that you can
choose via a pull-down in the right most column.  They should be
self-explanatory.  Above that column is the little white plus sign
that brings up the tournament creation modal dialog (see below).</p>
<p>The column labeled <code>#</code> is the number of players currently signed up.  If
you want to see which players are signed up, bring your cursor over that
number and the entrants' nicknames will be revealed.</p>
<p>The starting time is in the timezone that your browser is configured
to display.  That's normally the timezone you're in, but check the
three letter timezone abbreviation to be sure.</p>
<p>A synopsis of the tournament structure is in the <code>Tournament</code> column.
If you bring your cursor over the synopsis, more details will drop
down.</p>
<p>The rest of the lobby is chat and a box for you to enter chat.  All
chat is logged, however, currently only chat that occurs after you
sign in will be displayed.  That's pretty poor behavior and will be
improved.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#creation-of-a-new-tournament" id="creation-of-a-new-tournament">Creation of a new tournament</a></h3>
<p>If you click on the white plus small icon, you get the following dialog:</p>
<p><img src="./create-tournament.png" alt="Create Tournament" title="Create Tournament" /></p>
<p>The Structure attribute is a pull-down menu from one of approximately
50 pre-existing tournament structures.  Currently you can not create your
own structure, although traditionally the winner of the 5pm PDT tournament
gets to pick the following day's tournaments and may request a new
structure.</p>
<p>Tournaments that are created for testing or demo purposes should be
Free, since free tournaments don't affect anyone's standings.
Tournaments where people are expected to play well should probably
have a 100 buy-in if for no other reason than to make it clear that
the participants will be taking the tournament seriously.</p>
<p>Adding a comment is optional.  If you add a comment, it will show up
when people hover over the tournament structure in the listing of
upcoming tournaments.</p>
<p>Start At is in the same timezone as upcoming tournaments are displayed in.
That's whatever your browser thinks your timezone is.  The first time
you bring up the &quot;Add a Tournament&quot; dialog, &quot;Start At&quot; is pre-populated
with a value that is ten minutes into the future.  However, after that,
the dialog simply remembers whatever value was in that field previously.</p>
<p>Round Duration (Minutes) is in essence a scaling factor.  In most
tournaments, all rounds are the same length.  When create a new tournament
and specify the round duration, what you're <em>really</em> doing is saying how
long you want the first round to be.  If any rounds have a different duration
from the duration of the first round, they'll be scaled.</p>
<p>So, if there's a structure where the odd numbered rounds are 20 minutes
and the even numbered rounds are 30 minutes, if you specify Round
Duration as 5 minutes, then you'll have a tournament where the odd
numbered rounds are 5 minutes and the even ones are 7.5 minutes.</p>
<p>The TOC (Tournament of Champions) style format has a 15 minute Hold'em
first round, an 18 minute Stud second round and a 22 minute Omaha/8
third round.  So, if &quot;Round Duration (Minutes)&quot; is set to 5, then the
second round will be 6 minutes and the third round will be seven
minutes, twenty seconds long.</p>
<p>For a dozen or so players, five minute rounds for most structures results
in a tournament that finishes in about an hour and a half.</p>
<p>Seconds to Act is how much time a player gets to act before being sent
to vacation.  No, 999 is not a reasonable number of &quot;Seconds to Act&quot;.
Typically we use 45 there and that's the default when this dialog comes
up.</p>
<p>A player may call time to get more time to act.  There currently is no
limit on how many times a player can call time.  Calling time resets
the number of seconds to act (it does <em>not</em> add to the number of
seconds to act).  So, if &quot;Seconds to Act after calling Time&quot; is set to
60, calling time will mean that the player must act within 60 seconds
regardless of how much time to act the player had remaining.</p>
<p>Schedules have breaks built into them, and like Round Duration, they
scale based on the same ration of the &quot;Round Duration (Minutes)&quot;
setting to the duration of the first level in the structure.  That can
result in breaks that would be too short were it not for the &quot;Minimum
Break Duration in Minutes&quot; setting.  However, the duration of a break
is like the duration of a round in that it can start in the middle of
a hand. The players who are still in the hand still need to finish the
hand.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#top-line" id="top-line">Top Line</a></h1>
<p>At the top of the lobby you're told your nickname (e.g., <code>☕ deadhead</code>). That can be useful if you want to see how you've
customized your nickname (e.g., with capitalization, punctuation,
white-space or emojis).</p>
<p>Immediately to the right is a drop-down menu that allows you to see
some reports (at minimum the net profit leaderboard and the recent
tournaments).</p>
<p>Beyond that is a drop-down menu to the rules for all the games Mb2
knows how to deal.</p>
<p>The final item is a bell, which allows you to mute the gong. The gong
is rung when a new tournament is added.  That alerts people to the
presence of the new tournament so they can sign up. If your bell is
green, the gong will be played. If gray, it won't.  If you hover
your mouse over the bell, it will tell you its status.</p>
<p>Two daily tournaments (the 5:05pm PDT and 8:10pm PDT) have the
tradition of encouraging the winner to pick the following day's
tournament. It's viscerally satisfying to win, create the successor

<p>Mb2 can deal around fifty different variations of poker. This includes
common ones like Texas Hold'em, Omaha and Seven Card Stud as well as
lesser known games like Badugi, Courchevel and Big O.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ceemeck.org/BARGERuleBook2020/">BARGE Rule Book</a> has
rules to all but two of the games mb2 deals.  The exceptions are
Mexican Poker and Redrum.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#mexican-poker" id="mexican-poker">Mexican Poker</a></h1>
<p>The best source of rules for Mexican Poker are
<a href="https://www.thebike.com/play/poker_mexican_poker.php">those at The Bicycle</a>.
However, the
<a href="https://poker.fandom.com/wiki/Mexican_Poker">ones at Poker Fandom</a>
aren't bad except they incorrectly claim that the lowest up-card is the
bring-in (The Bicycle rules get that right).  Additionally, the
<a href="https://www.wsop.com/2019/2019%20WSOP%20Live%20Action%20Rules%20(FINAL).pdf">WSOP 2019 document</a>
also has their explanation (although you'll have to search for &quot;Mexican
Poker&quot; to find them).</p>
<p>The big things to know about Mexican Poker on mb2 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Up and Down buttons refer to how you want your next card dealt</li>
<li>Mb2 does not <em>visually</em> discriminate between a down-dealt and an up-dealt joker</li>
</ul>
<p>Mb2 does recognize that a down-dealt joker is wild, even if it's
subsequently turned up.  So, the right thing will happen, but there's
currently no visual representation reminding you the state of the
joker.  This can be trivially fixed, but it requires someone to create
assets and we haven't yet requested anyone to create them, since the
current interface will be going away &quot;soon&quot;.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#structures" id="structures">Structures</a></h1>
<h1><a class="header" href="#lammers" id="lammers">Lammers</a></h1>
<p>Some of the tournament structures (typically limited to big-bet)
include lammers in addition to starting chips.  Each lammer is worth a
fixed amount and can be used in four different ways:</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#redemption-before-the-first-hand" id="redemption-before-the-first-hand">Redemption Before the First Hand</a></h3>
<p>If you want to redeem any of your lammers before the first hand, you
must use the &quot;extra options&quot; menu from the lobby that's the rightmost
column in the upcoming tournaments area.  The leftmost column is the
check-box that you use to join.  The rightmost column is a down
chevron that has a drop-down menu associated with it.  When a
tournament uses lammers, that drop-down allows you to specify how many
of the lammers you want to redeem before the start of the first hand.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#manual-redemption-during-the-game" id="manual-redemption-during-the-game">Manual Redemption During The Game</a></h3>
<p>The redeem command (requires use of the command text box) takes a
single numeric argument that specifies how many lammers you wish to
redeem (e.g., <code>redeem 2</code>).</p>
<p>If you are in a hand, the redemption will happen at the end of that
hand.  If you have a redemption scheduled for the end of the hand and
you change your mind you can use <code>redeem 0</code>.</p>
<p>If you're not in a hand, the redemption will happen immediately and can
not be reverted.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#resurrection" id="resurrection">Resurrection</a></h3>
<p>If you bust and you have one or more lammers left, exactly one lammer
will be cashed in and you'll be back in the game with the amount of
chips that lammer is worth.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#forced-redemption" id="forced-redemption">Forced Redemption</a></h3>
<p>Typically there's a final level where lammers are allowed and if you
finish that level, all lammers you have are redeemed for you (and all
your opponents) automatically.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#limitations" id="limitations">Limitations</a></h1>
<p>There are far too many limitations in the current UI to list them here. As
such, the only limitation that I'm listing is one that caught me by surprise
and was initially labeled as a <a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/labels/bug">bug</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#some-icons-dont-show-up-on-iphones" id="some-icons-dont-show-up-on-iphones">Some icons don't show up on iPhones</a></h2>
<p>Ugly as it may be, all the functionality of the UI is available on
&quot;full sized&quot; devices (e.g., computer monitors with a modern
resolution). However, on iPhones some functionality is actually
missing, specifically there's <a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues/300">no create event icon, nor is there a
down chevron</a>.  Since the
current UI is going away, I decided to document that limitation rather
than have it persist as a bug in mb2's <a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues">issue
tracker</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#esoterica" id="esoterica">Esoterica</a></h1>
<h1><a class="header" href="#github" id="github">GitHub</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/about">GitHub</a> is a wonderful service for
programmers, but if you don't already know what it is, you <em>probably</em>
don't want to join it just to use your GitHub account to log in to
Mb2, but you can if you want.</p>
<p>Mb2 currently supports signing-on (and signing-up) via GitHub as a
proof-of-concept for allowing logging in through social media.  GitHub
was chosen to be first because Mb2's user interface currently is
&quot;sub-optimal&quot; (<code>/me chuckles</code>) and as such the next tranche to be
exposed to Mb2 are likely to be people who can look beyond the
surface, e.g., programmers.</p>
<p>If you sign-in via GitHub, your account's canonical name will be your
GitHub account's name canonicalized. You can customize your nickname by
putting the customization in the <code>Nickname</code> field of the sign-up and then
clicking the <code>Login with GitHub</code> button. Your customization will only
be accepted if it is compatible with your canonicalized name.</p>
<p>As an example of customization, if your GitHub account name is <code>ctm</code> and
you put <code>Ctm!</code> in the <code>Nickname</code> field, then when you're logged in, your
nickname will be <code>Ctm!</code>. If, however, you put <code>deadhead</code> in the <code>Nickname</code>
field, then your nickname will simply be the unadorned <code>ctm</code>.</p>
<p>FWIW, GitHub hosts the <a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/tree/master/src">source to this Player's
Manual</a>, this Player's
Manual itself, <a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues">Mb2's issue
tracker</a> and the source to mb2
(in a private repository).</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#table-balancing" id="table-balancing">Table Balancing</a></h1>
<p>When there are three or more tables in a tournament, mb2 will keep the
player counts of each table within two of each other. It will do this
by moving one player at the end of the hand from a table that has more
than two more players than the smallest table.  The player that is
moved will be the player that has the worst position (e.g., about to
take the big blind). That player will be moved into the worst
position.  As such, that player will not move into a worse position
than that player would have been in anyway.</p>
<p>When there are enough empty seats to accommodate all the players in the
smallest table, that table will be broken. The players at the broken
table will be assigned to other tables at random.</p>
<p>When there are two tables, mb2 will keep the player counts of each of the
two tables within one of each other.  It will rebalance the same way
that is done when there are more than two tables.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#sevens-rule" id="sevens-rule">Sevens Rule</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#sevens-rule-definition" id="sevens-rule-definition">Sevens Rule Definition</a></h2>
<p>The Sevens Rule applies only to California Lowball. It is simply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the draw, if you have a seven or better, you may not check it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the purposes of the Sevens Rule, calling an amount that is less
than the post-draw bet size is considered a check. The only way that
can happen is if the first player to bet goes all-in for less than the
post-draw bet size.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#penalty" id="penalty">Penalty</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#sevens-rule-penalty" id="sevens-rule-penalty">Sevens Rule Penalty</a></h2>
<p>The penalty is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After violating the Sevens Rule, further action from that player,
for the remainder of that hand, will be lost or returned. It will
never increase the amount to be won above the amount to be won
pre-violation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a player checks a seven and subsequently folds or loses the hand,
there is no penalty, because that player would not win anything
anyway.</p>
<p>However, if a player checks a seven, post-draw, and shows the best
hand, all of that player's post-check action is returned to the
player.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if no other hand tied the best hand shown by the
violator, then everyone's action beyond that check, from any pot that
includes that hand, is returned.</p>
<p>If there is a tie between one or more Sevens Rule violators and one or
more Sevens Rule followers, the post-draw action of the Sevens Rule
violators is returned to the violators and the remaining amount in the
pot is awarded to the non-violator (or split evenly if more than one
non-violator has a tying winning hand).</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#examples" id="examples">Examples</a></h1>

It's worth reading, although it's slightly incorrect and will be updated
soon..</p>
