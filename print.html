<p>Mb2 is poker software with a nice friendly user base.</p>
<p>Mb2 is in an early stage of development.  The server itself is world-class,
full-featured, state-of-the art.  However…</p>
<p>The user interface is currently rough and this documentation is
rougher.  Both improve every day, so if you don't like what you see
now, come back tomorrow, … or wait a week and see even greater
improvement.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#demo" id="demo">Demo</a></h1>
<p>There's a button labeled <code>Demo</code> on
<a href="https://devctm.com" title="Pre-alpha">https://devctm.com</a></p>
<p>Go to the site, click that button, and you'll be told to type <code>start</code>
in the chat box to start a 2-player No-Limit Texas Hold'em tournament.</p>
<p>If you have the <code>shift</code> key down when you click <code>Demo</code>, you'll be able
to choose more than 2 players and <a href="./games.html">games</a> (technically
<a href="./structures.html">structures</a>) other than No Limit Hold'em.</p>
<p>Using the demo, you'll start in the <a href="./lobby.html">lobby</a>, with a demo
<a href="./accounts.html">account</a>. Demo accounts are able to chat with non-demo
accounts in the lobby, but are not allowed to join non-demo events.
So, after you've played with the demo a little, you may want to create
an user account.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#accounts" id="accounts">Accounts</a></h1>
<p>Accounts are free.</p>
<p>You may create more than one, but please don't mislead.</p>
<p>Currently, no email account is associated with an account. Mb2's
purpose is to provide fun, not to sell you things or collect your
information. Mb2 currently doesn't even use cookies, nor does it
record your IP address.</p>
<p>Your password is never stored in a database. Instead, a hash of your
password is stored. That means there's no way for anyone associated
with mb2 to recover your password.  Since mb2 doesn't use email
addresses, the only way to have your password reset is to ask (e.g.,
via chat or email).  So, when you create an account, please remember
or write down your password.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#lobby" id="lobby">Lobby</a></h1>
<p>After you sign in, you'll be in the lobby, where you can see the active
tables, a list of upcoming tournaments and recent chat.</p>
<p><img src="./lobby.png" alt="Lobby" title="Lobby" /></p>
<p>The first line in the lobby is the nickname you've logged in as.  You may
have more than one nickname, but please don't use multiple nicknames to
mislead, collude or dump chips.</p>
<p>The second line lists the others logged in.</p>
<p>If any tables are active, each gets a row with the table id and a list
of the players at that table.  The table id itself is a link.  If you
click on it, you'll get a pop-up that allows you to observe that table.</p>
<p>Any upcoming tournaments that you're allowed to join are then
listed. To join, click the check-box.  If you change your mind, before
the tournament starts, just click the check-box again.</p>
<p>When you join a tournament there may be esoteric options that you can
choose via a pull-down in the right most column.  They should be
self-explanatory.  Above that column is the little white plus sign
that brings up the tournament creation modal dialog (see below).</p>
<p>The column labeled <code>#</code> is the number of players currently signed up.  If
you want to see which players are signed up, bring your cursor over that
number and the entrants' nicknames will be revealed.</p>
<p>The starting time is in the timezone that your browser is configured
to display.  That's normally the timezone you're in, but check the
three letter timezone abbreviation to be sure.</p>
<p>A synopsis of the tournament structure is in the <code>Tournament</code> column.
If you bring your cursor over the synopsis, more details will drop
down.</p>
<p>The rest of the lobby is chat and a box for you to enter chat.  All
chat is logged, however, currently only chat that occurs after you
sign in will be displayed.  That's pretty poor behavior and will be
improved.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#creation-of-a-new-tournament" id="creation-of-a-new-tournament">Creation of a new tournament</a></h3>
<p>If you click on the white plus small icon, you get the following dialog:</p>
<p><img src="./create-tournament.png" alt="Create Tournament" title="Create Tournament" /></p>
<p>The Structure attribute is a pull-down menu from one of approximately
50 pre-existing tournament structures.  Currently you can not create your
own structure, although traditionally the winner of the 5pm PDT tournament
gets to pick the following day's tournaments and may request a new
structure.</p>
<p>Tournaments that are created for testing or demo purposes should be
Free, since free tournaments don't affect anyone's standings.
Tournaments where people are expected to play well should probably
have a 100 buy-in if for no other reason than to make it clear that
the participants will be taking the tournament seriously.</p>
<p>Adding a comment is optional.  If you add a comment, it will show up
when people hover over the tournament structure in the listing of
upcoming tournaments.</p>
<p>Start At is in the same timezone as upcoming tournaments are displayed in.
That's whatever your browser thinks your timezone is.  The first time
you bring up the &quot;Add a Tournament&quot; dialog, &quot;Start At&quot; is pre-populated
with a value that is ten minutes into the future.  However, after that,
the dialog simply remembers whatever value was in that field previously.</p>
<p>Round Duration (Minutes) is in essence a scaling factor.  In most
tournaments, all rounds are the same length.  When create a new tournament
and specify the round duration, what you're <em>really</em> doing is saying how
long you want the first round to be.  If any rounds have a different duration
from the duration of the first round, they'll be scaled.</p>
<p>So, if there's a structure where the odd numbered rounds are 20 minutes
and the even numbered rounds are 30 minutes, if you specify Round
Duration as 5 minutes, then you'll have a tournament where the odd
numbered rounds are 5 minutes and the even ones are 7.5 minutes.</p>
<p>The TOC (Tournament of Champions) style format has a 15 minute Hold'em
first round, an 18 minute Stud second round and a 22 minute Omaha/8
third round.  So, if &quot;Round Duration (Minutes)&quot; is set to 5, then the
second round will be 6 minutes and the third round will be seven
minutes, twenty seconds long.</p>
<p>For a dozen or so players, five minute rounds for most structures results
in a tournament that finishes in about an hour and a half.</p>
<p>Seconds to Act is how much time a player gets to act before being sent
to vacation.  No, 999 is not a reasonable number of &quot;Seconds to Act&quot;.
Typically we use 45 there and that's the default when this dialog comes
up.</p>
<p>A player may call time to get more time to act.  There currently is no
limit on how many times a player can call time.  Calling time resets
the number of seconds to act (it does <em>not</em> add to the number of
seconds to act).  So, if &quot;Seconds to Act after calling Time&quot; is set to
60, calling time will mean that the player must act within 60 seconds
regardless of how much time to act the player had remaining.</p>
<p>Schedules have breaks built into them, and like Round Duration, they
scale based on the same ration of the &quot;Round Duration (Minutes)&quot;
setting to the duration of the first level in the structure.  That can
result in breaks that would be too short were it not for the &quot;Minimum
Break Duration in Minutes&quot; setting.  However, the duration of a break
is like the duration of a round in that it can start in the middle of
a hand. The players who are still in the hand still need to finish the
hand.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#top-line" id="top-line">Top Line</a></h1>
<p>At the top of the lobby you're told your nickname (e.g., <code>☕ deadhead</code>). That can be useful if you want to see how you've
customized your nickname (e.g., with capitalization, punctuation,
whitespace or emojis).</p>
<p>Immediately to the right is a drop-down menu that allows you to see
some reports (at minimum the net profit leaderboard and the recent
tournaments).</p>
<p>The final item is a bell, which allows you to mute the gong. The gong
is rung when a new tournament is added.  That alerts people to the
presence of the new tournament so they can sign up. If your bell is
green, the gong will be played. If gray, it won't.  If you hover
your mouse over the bell, it will tell you its status.</p>
<p>Two daily tournaments (the 5:05pm PDT and 8:10pm PDT) have the
tradition of encouraging the winner to pick the following day's
tournament. It's viscerally satisfying to win, create the successor
tournament and then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4o4Q9sd_y4">bang a
gong</a>.</p>
