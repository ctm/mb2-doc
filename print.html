<p>Mb2 is poker software with a nice friendly player base.</p>
<p>Mb2 is in an early stage of development.  The server is world-class,
full-featured and state-of-the art.  However, the user interface is currently
mostly unstyled.</p>
<p>The server improves almost every day. The styling of the user interface has
slipped repeatedly, but has not been forgotten nor is it being ignored.</p>
<h3 id="read-no-further-try-the-demo"><a class="header" href="#read-no-further-try-the-demo">Read no further, Try the <a href="https://devctm.com">Demo</a></a></h3>
<p>Although ugly, the user interface is <em>mostly</em> self explanatory.  As
such, you can try the <a href="https://devctm.com">demo</a> and only come back to
this document if you're curious.</p>
<p>There's more information about the demo on the next page of this book.
To advance to the next page, scroll to the bottom of this page and
then click the <code>&gt;</code> in the lower right corner.</p>
<h3 id="come-back-at-3pm-pacific-or-5pm-pacific-or-8pm-pacific"><a class="header" href="#come-back-at-3pm-pacific-or-5pm-pacific-or-8pm-pacific">Come back at 3pm Pacific (or 5pm Pacific, or 8pm Pacific)</a></h3>
<p>If you'd like to win an engraved glass paperweight, play in our 3pm Pacific
<a href="./series/wsop-style-2022.html">WSOP-Style tournament series</a>.  It runs through
Sunday, July 3rd, 2022.</p>
<p>Additionally, two other tournaments are scheduled later in the day.
The only things to win in these later tournaments are bragging rights
and the privilege to pick the structure for the same tournament on the
following day (e.g., the winner of the evening tournament chooses the
structure for the evening tournament for the following day).</p>
<p>The evening
tournament begins at 5pm Pacific and the night tournament at 8pm
Pacific.  So, figure out what time they start in your time zone and
join us. For now you'll be using the horrible interface to play with
great people.  Someday you can look back wistfully when you're playing
on a great interface with horrible people...</p>
<h3 id="this-manual-is-player-driven"><a class="header" href="#this-manual-is-player-driven">This manual is… Player Driven</a></h3>
<p>Maintaining this documentation is currently, low-priority.</p>
<p>The regular players already know most of the information herein and
&quot;outsiders&quot; become insiders simply by joining and playing. However, if
there's anything you're curious about, ask in the lobby. Not only is
it likely that someone will answer, but your question and its answer
may well make it into this manual and help someone else.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="demo"><a class="header" href="#demo">Demo</a></h1>
<p>There's a button labeled <code>Demo</code> on
<a href="https://devctm.com" title="Pre-alpha">https://devctm.com</a></p>
<p>Go to the site, click that <code>Demo</code> button, and you'll be presented with
a modal dialog.</p>
<h3 id="default-values"><a class="header" href="#default-values">Default Values</a></h3>
<p>If you click the <code>CREATE</code> button without changing any of the values in
that dialog, you'll get a 2-player No-Limit Texas Hold'em tournament
whose structure is based on the 2022 World Series of Poker Main Event.</p>
<p>You'll then be logged into a demo <a href="./accounts.html">account</a> and be
placed in the <a href="./lobby.html">lobby</a>.  At the bottom of the lobby chat
will be instructions in red telling you to click the <code>Start</code> button to
start the tournament you just created.</p>
<p>When you click <code>Start</code>, your browser will attempt to open two pop-up
windows, one for each player.  If a pop-up blocker prevents the windows
from being opened, you'll told how to proceed.</p>
<h3 id="to-demo-something-other-than-2-player-texas-holdem"><a class="header" href="#to-demo-something-other-than-2-player-texas-holdem">To Demo Something other than 2 Player Texas Hold'em</a></h3>
<p>If you'd rather explore something else, you can see other
<a href="./games.html">games</a> by choosing a different
<a href="./structures.html">structure</a>.</p>
<h3 id="demo-limitations"><a class="header" href="#demo-limitations">Demo Limitations</a></h3>
<p>Demo accounts are able to chat with non-demo accounts, but are not
allowed to join events that require a buy-in (the events that don't
require buy-ins are demo events and testing events).</p>
<p>You are not able to change preferences of a demo account.</p>
<p>So, after you've played with the demo, you may want to create your own account.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="accounts"><a class="header" href="#accounts">Accounts</a></h1>
<p>Accounts are free.</p>
<p>You may create more than one, but please don't mislead.</p>
<p>Currently, no email account is associated with an account. Mb2's
purpose is to provide fun, not to sell you things or collect (much
less sell) your information. Mb2 currently doesn't even use cookies,
nor does it record your IP address.</p>
<h3 id="no-password-recovery-only-reset"><a class="header" href="#no-password-recovery-only-reset">No Password Recovery, Only Reset</a></h3>
<p>Your password is never stored in a database. Instead, a hash of a hash
of your password is stored (the first hash is done on the client side
so that your password is not sent to the server). Consequently there's
no way for anyone associated with mb2 to recover (or even observe)
your password.  Since mb2 doesn't use email addresses, the only way to
have your password reset is to ask (e.g., via chat or email).  So,
when you create an account, please remember or write down your
password.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="privacy"><a class="header" href="#privacy">Privacy</a></h1>
<p>At the time this page was written, every detail was correct.  However,
while mb2 is still under rapid deployment, there's a chance that some
of the information on this page may inadvertently become outdated.
So, don't bet your life—or anyone else's—that the
information here is correct.</p>
<p>Everyone's privacy is important to the developers of mb2. As such, mb2
does not use cookies.  Mb2 does, however, use your browser's session
storage and local storage to keep track of your being logged in and
connected to tables.  So, were your computer to be forensically
examined, it would be possible to tell that you've been connected to
mb2.</p>
<p>Mb2 logs almost all traffic between the client and the server.  The
exception is that your login credentials are not logged. These logs
are used for debugging and are currently retained forever.</p>
<p>Mb2 uses Cloudflare as a content delivery network, but the WebSockets
that connect your lobby and table pages to the server do not run
through Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Mb2 currently runs on AWS (Amazon Web Services). The initial
connection your browser makes to mb2 runs through an AWS Application
Load Balancer (ALB) which decrypts that initial HTTPS connection.
However, the successive connections your browser makes to mb2's server
run on WebSockets and the WebSocket connections do not go through an
ALB. These WebSockets are WSS encrypted and the traffic is decoded on
the AWS instance running mb2 (i.e., it is not decrypted at the Load
Balancer). Authentication credentials (e.g. your password's hash) are
only passed through the WebSockets.</p>
<h3 id="github-authentication"><a class="header" href="#github-authentication">GitHub Authentication</a></h3>
<p>As a proof-of-concept, mb2 allows players to create accounts using
GitHub's <a href="https://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> server.  Nobody is required or
even encouraged to use this obscure feature. It exists simply to make
sure that mb2's authorization subsystem supported OAuth. It is likely
that other OAuth servers will also be supported as options for
authorizing, but mb2 will never require an account to be created via
OAuth.  So, if you don't want Microsoft knowing you're using mb2,
don't use the GitHub Authentication.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="security"><a class="header" href="#security">Security</a></h1>
<p>Some of mb2's <a href="./privacy.html">privacy</a> features also provide a modicum
of security. Specifically, your password and all of your actions are
encrypted by your web browser and decrypted only inside mb2.
Similarly, your hole cards are encrypted by mb2 and only decrypted by
your browser.</p>
<p>Although mb2 logs your actions and your hole (or other down) cards,
those logs remain in mb2's memory until the hand is over. Only after
the hand has finished is that information logged to mb2's database.
Mb2 uses an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL Database instance that is encrypted
at rest.  Mb2 communicates with its database using SSL.</p>
<p>Your password is never stored.  Instead, a hash of your password is
stored.  That is sufficient for mb2 to be able to tell if you have
provided your password when you sign in. However, your password can
never be recovered, although it can be reset.</p>
<p>During development, mb2 uses
<a href="https://rust-random.github.io/book/guide-rngs.html?highlight=thread_rng#our-rngs"><code>thread_rng</code></a>
from the <a href="https://docs.rs/rand/0.8.3/rand/">rand crate</a> (crates are
essentially Rust libraries. Rust is the language mb2 is written
in). The authors of <code>thread_rng</code> believe it to be <a href="https://rust-random.github.io/book/guide-gen.html#cryptographically-secure-pseudo-random-number-generator">cryptographically
secure</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="new-to-poker"><a class="header" href="#new-to-poker">New to Poker?</a></h1>
<p>If you're new to poker, mb2 might be a little overwhelming. The
current mb2 player base is a group of people who already have quite a
lot of online poker experience.  Most of the current participants know
each other or want to help test the software or like the fact that mb2
deals a lot of esoteric games.</p>
<p>The current industry leader is PokerStars and they have a <a href="https://www.pokerstars.bet/poker/games/">nice
page</a> you can view without
registering.  An up and coming challenger to PokerStars is GGPoker and
they have a <a href="https://en.ggpoker.com/get-started/poker-school/">Poker
School</a> that
requires registration. PokerStars also has a
<a href="https://www.pokerstarsschool.com/">school</a>.</p>
<p>From mb2's developer's point of view, poker can—and
should—be fun, but poker can also be addicting. We're pro-fun
and anti-addiction (but non-judgmental). Nothing about mb2 is designed
to encourage you to play too much poker, much less get addicted.</p>
<p>If you play on mb2, great! Welcome aboard.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lobby"><a class="header" href="#lobby">Lobby</a></h1>
<p>After you sign in, you'll be in the lobby, where you can see the active
tables, a list of upcoming tournaments and recent chat.</p>
<p><img src="./lobby.png" alt="Lobby" title="Lobby" /></p>
<p>The <a href="./lobby/top_line.html">top line</a> in the lobby starts with the
nickname you've logged in as. After that are icons.</p>
<p>The second line lists the others logged in.</p>
<p>If any tables are active, each gets a row with the table id and a list
of the players at that table.  The table id itself is a link.  If you
click on it, you'll get a new window that allows you to observe that table.</p>
<p>The list of players at a table does not include former players or
observers. When a player busts, that player remains at the table as an
observer until that player leaves (i.e., closes the table window).</p>
<p>Any upcoming tournaments that you're allowed to join are listed below.
To join, click the check-box.  If you change your mind before
the tournament starts, click the check-box again and your buy-in will
be refunded and you won't be in the tournament when it starts.</p>
<p>When you join a tournament there may be esoteric options that you can
choose via a pull-down in the right most column.  They should be
self-explanatory.  Above that column is the little white plus sign
that brings up the tournament creation modal dialog (see below).</p>
<p>The column labeled <code>#</code> is the number of players currently signed up.  If
you want to see which players are signed up, bring your cursor over that
number and the entrants' nicknames will be revealed.</p>
<p>The starting time is in the timezone that your browser is configured
to display.  That's normally the timezone you're in, but check the
three letter timezone abbreviation to be sure.</p>
<p>A synopsis of the tournament structure is in the <code>Tournament</code> column.
If you bring your cursor over the synopsis, more details will drop
down.</p>
<p>The rest of the lobby is chat and a box for you to type your own chat.
All chat is logged, but only the chat from the last twenty-four hours
is displayed when you log in.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="top-line"><a class="header" href="#top-line">Top Line</a></h1>
<h3 id="your-nickname"><a class="header" href="#your-nickname">Your Nickname</a></h3>
<p>At the top of the lobby is your nickname (e.g., <code>☕ deadhead</code>). That can be useful if you want to see how you've
customized your nickname (e.g., with capitalization, punctuation,
white-space or emojis).</p>
<h2 id="players-manual"><a class="header" href="#players-manual">Players Manual</a></h2>
<p>Immediately to the right is circled-i icon.  If you click that icon,
this Players' Manual is opened in a new tab or window.</p>
<h2 id="reports"><a class="header" href="#reports">Reports</a></h2>
<p>The next icon looks like three horizontal lines, each with a dot
in front of them.  This is the reports drop-down icon. It's where
you can choose to see various leaderboards or the recent tournaments.</p>
<h3 id="leaderboards"><a class="header" href="#leaderboards">Leaderboards</a></h3>
<p>By default, the net profit leaderboards only show
players who have won more Fun Money in payouts than they've paid in
buy-ins. However, if you have a non-positive balance and you want to
see it, you can hold down the shift key when you click one of the
leaderboard menu items.  If you hold the shift key down when you click
and you don't see your nick, then no tournaments have finished that
you were entered in.</p>
<h3 id="recent-tournaments"><a class="header" href="#recent-tournaments">Recent Tournaments</a></h3>
<p>Recent Tournaments brings up a list of the non-demo/non-test
tournaments that have finished in the last month.</p>
<p>Each row contains the starting date and time of the tournament, the
Fun Money buy-in, the number of entrants and the name of the Event.
If you click on a row, the results from that tournament are displayed.</p>
<h4 id="bragging-or-crying-rights"><a class="header" href="#bragging-or-crying-rights">Bragging (or crying) Rights</a></h4>
<p>When you bring up the results of a specific tournament, there is a
little icon to the right of the name of that tournament. It looks like
a couple of (three if you count the sideways one) links in a chain. If
you click on that icon, the URL for this result will be copied to the
pasteboard which can then be pasted into email, twitter or some other
messaging system.</p>
<p>Here's an example: <a href="https://devctm.com/event/3083/player/10">https://devctm.com/event/3083/player/10</a></p>
<h2 id="rules"><a class="header" href="#rules">Rules</a></h2>
<p>Beyond that is a drop-down menu to the rules for almost all the games
Mb2 knows how to deal.  Action Razzdugi does not currently have an
entry, but it's just like Razzdugi, except the Razz half is Action
Razz.</p>
<h2 id="audio"><a class="header" href="#audio">Audio</a></h2>
<p>The next item is a bell, which allows you to mute the gong. The gong
is rung when a new tournament is added.  That alerts people to the
presence of the new tournament so they can sign up. If your bell is
green, the gong will be played. If gray, it won't.  If you hover
your mouse over the bell, it will tell you its status.</p>
<p>Two daily tournaments (the 5:05pm Pacific and 8:10pm Pacific) have the
tradition of encouraging the winner to pick the following day's
tournament. It's viscerally satisfying to win, create the successor
tournament and then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4o4Q9sd_y4">bang a
gong</a>.</p>
<h2 id="preferences"><a class="header" href="#preferences">Preferences</a></h2>
<p>If you are logged in to a non-demo account, your final icon will be
what looks like three horizontal sliders. Clicking it allows you to
set <a href="lobby/./preferences.html">preferences</a> that are remembered
indefinitely.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="creating-tournaments"><a class="header" href="#creating-tournaments">Creating Tournaments</a></h1>
<p>In the <a href="lobby/../lobby.html">lobby</a>, if you click on the white plus small icon, you get
a dialog that looks something like:</p>
<p><img src="lobby/./create-tournament.png" alt="Create Tournament" title="Create Tournament" /></p>
<h3 id="type"><a class="header" href="#type">Type</a></h3>
<p>For now, just leave the Type as <code>Tournament</code>.</p>
<h3 id="structure"><a class="header" href="#structure">Structure</a></h3>
<p>The Structure attribute is a pull-down menu from one of more than a
hundred pre-existing tournament structures.  Currently you can not
create your own structure.</p>
<h3 id="buy-in"><a class="header" href="#buy-in">Buy-in</a></h3>
<p>Tournaments that are created for testing or demo purposes should be
Free, since free tournaments don't affect anyone's standings.
Tournaments where people are expected to play well should
have a 100 buy-in if for no other reason than to make it clear that
the participants will be taking the tournament seriously.</p>
<h3 id="bounty"><a class="header" href="#bounty">Bounty</a></h3>
<p>If the <code>25</code> radio button is selected, then sufficient Fun Money is
deducted from the prize pool so that an award of FM 25 can be made to
the player who busts another player.  If N people are in a tournament,
then N-1 bounties will be paid out by the time the tournament ends.</p>
<h3 id="comment"><a class="header" href="#comment">Comment</a></h3>
<p>Adding a comment is optional.  If you add a comment, it will show up
when people hover over the tournament structure in the listing of
upcoming tournaments.</p>
<h3 id="autostart"><a class="header" href="#autostart">Autostart</a></h3>
<p>If you put a number in the <code>Autostart</code> field, then the tournament will
start automatically once that number of participants join. In general,
you should not create an autostart tournament unless you think there
are enough people in the lobby to sign up within five or ten minutes,
otherwise you may find that nobody will sign up because it will be too
hard to predict when it will start.</p>
<p>If you put a number in <code>Autostart</code>, the <code>Start At</code> field will be removed.
You can only either start by <code>Autostart</code> or <code>Start At</code>, not both.</p>
<h3 id="start-at"><a class="header" href="#start-at">Start At</a></h3>
<p>Start At is in the same timezone as upcoming tournaments are displayed in.
That's whatever your browser thinks your timezone is.  The first time
you bring up the &quot;Add a Tournament&quot; dialog, &quot;Start At&quot; is pre-populated
with a value that is ten minutes into the future.  However, after that,
the dialog simply remembers whatever value was in that field previously.</p>
<p>If the lobby observes that you've won a tournament, then the next time
you create a tournament, Start At will be pre-populated with the same
starting time as the tournament you won, but be on the following
day. This helps people who win the evening or night tournaments,
because the convention is to let the winner choose the tournament for
the following day.</p>
<h3 id="round-duration"><a class="header" href="#round-duration">Round Duration</a></h3>
<p>Round Duration (Minutes) is in essence a scaling factor.  In most
tournaments, all rounds are the same length.  When create a new tournament
and specify the round duration, what you're <em>really</em> doing is saying how
long you want the first round to be.  If any rounds have a different duration
from the duration of the first round, they'll be scaled.</p>
<p>So, if there's a structure where the odd numbered rounds are 20 minutes
and the even numbered rounds are 30 minutes, if you specify Round
Duration as 5 minutes, then you'll have a tournament where the odd
numbered rounds are 5 minutes and the even ones are 7.5 minutes.</p>
<p>The TOC (Tournament of Champions) style format has a 15 minute Hold'em
first round, an 18 minute Stud second round and a 22 minute Omaha/8
third round.  So, if &quot;Round Duration (Minutes)&quot; is set to 5, then the
second round will be 6 minutes and the third round will be seven
minutes, twenty seconds long.</p>
<p>For a dozen or so players, five minute rounds for most structures results
in a tournament that finishes in about an hour and a half.</p>
<h3 id="seconds-to-act"><a class="header" href="#seconds-to-act">Seconds to Act</a></h3>
<p>Seconds to Act is how much time a player gets to act before being sent
to vacation.  No, 999 is not a reasonable number of &quot;Seconds to Act&quot;.
Typically we use 45 there and that's the default when this dialog comes
up.</p>
<p>A player may call time to get more time to act.  There currently is no
limit on how many times a player can call time.  Calling time resets
the number of seconds to act (it does <em>not</em> add to the number of
seconds to act).  So, if &quot;Seconds to Act after calling Time&quot; is set to
60, calling time will mean that the player must act within 60 seconds
regardless of how much time to act the player had remaining.</p>
<h3 id="synchronized-breaks"><a class="header" href="#synchronized-breaks">Synchronized Breaks</a></h3>
<p>Schedules have breaks built into them, and like Round Duration, they
scale based on the same ration of the &quot;Round Duration (Minutes)&quot;
setting to the duration of the first level in the structure.  That can
result in breaks that would be too short were it not for the &quot;Minimum
Break Duration in Minutes&quot; setting.  However, the duration of a break
is like the duration of a round in that it can start in the middle of
a hand. The players who are still in the hand still need to finish the
hand.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="preferences-1"><a class="header" href="#preferences-1">Preferences</a></h1>
<p>If you click on the <a href="lobby/./top_line.html#preferences">preferences icon</a> in
the top line of the lobby, you'll get a modal dialog that looks
something like the following.</p>
<p>Almost all of these preferences control what will happen on subsequent
table windows created for you. The <code>New Tournament</code> check-box in the
<code>Sounds To Play</code> section is the exception. The New Tournament sound
comes from the lobby.</p>
<p>The slightly confusing options are: <code>Four Color When Badugi</code> <code>Deck Color</code> option and the <code>Only When Auto-Seated</code> <code>Auto-Center</code> option.</p>
<h3 id="four-color-when-badugi"><a class="header" href="#four-color-when-badugi">Four Color When Badugi</a></h3>
<p><code>Four Color When Badugi</code> is a setting &quot;between&quot; <code>Black and Red</code> and
<code>Four Color</code>.</p>
<p><code>Black and Red</code> always uses <strong>black</strong> for clubs and spades
and <span style="color:red">red</span> for diamonds and hearts.</p>
<p><code>Four Color</code> always uses <span style="color:green">green</span> for
clubs, <span style="color:blue">blue</span> for diamonds, <span style="color:red">red</span> for hearts and <strong>black</strong> for spades.</p>
<p><code>Four Color When Badugi</code> uses <code>Black and Red</code> unless the game currently
being played uses Badugi ranking when figuring out how to award or
split the pot, in which case <code>Four Color</code> is used. So whether or not
to use a four color deck can change each time the game changes.</p>
<h3 id="auto-seated"><a class="header" href="#auto-seated">Auto-Seated</a></h3>
<p>When you play a tournament, you do not get to choose your seat, hence
you are auto-seated.</p>
<p>When Ring Game support is added, you'll have the option of choosing
your seat when a seat is available or having a seat assigned to you
when coming off a wait list.</p>
<p>So, for now, there's basically no difference between <code>Always</code> and
<code>Only When Auto-Seated</code>.</p>
<p><img src="lobby/./preferences.png" alt="Preferences" title="Preferences Modal Dialog" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tables"><a class="header" href="#tables">Tables</a></h1>
<p>Mb2 creates a new pop-up window for each table you are seated at or you
are observing. A table looks something like this<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<p><img src="./table.png" alt="Table" title="Table" /></p>
<p>Most of the elements in a table window should be self-explanatory.
Additionally, most also have a &quot;tooltip&quot; associated with them.  The
tooltip will be revealed if you leave your mouse over an element
that contains a tooltip.</p>
<p>The remaining pages of this Tables chapter document or clarify some of
the things that may not be self-explanatory.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Currently, there are also two textual representations of a table,
but this manual ignores them because they are likely to go away after
the graphical interface becomes more attractive to the current text view
players.</p>
</div>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="top-line-1"><a class="header" href="#top-line-1">Top Line</a></h1>
<p>The upper left portion of a table consists of a row of icons that can be
clicked on. Most of them make temporary changes to the appearance of
your table. They all have associated tooltips that tell you what they'll
do if you click them.</p>
<h3 id="players-manual-1"><a class="header" href="#players-manual-1">Players Manual</a></h3>
<p>Like in the lobby, the left-most icon is a circled i.  If you click
that icon, this Players' Manual is opened in a new tab or window.</p>
<h3 id="table-view"><a class="header" href="#table-view">Table View</a></h3>
<p>The next icon switches between</p>
<ul>
<li>diagonal arrows pointing outward (at the top of the window)</li>
<li>diagonal arrows pointing inward (at the bottom of the window)</li>
<li>a landscape picture of mountains (at the bottom of the window)</li>
</ul>
<p>This icon is telling you what Will happen if you click it. If you're in the Table
view, you'll switch to the Text view.  If you're in the Text view and you
click it, you'll switch into the Compact Text view.</p>
<p>The text views are unsupported and undocumented. If you prefer to use
them, please let Cliff (aka deadhead) know what causes your preference
so that he can improve the graphical view to the point that you'll
prefer that to the text view.</p>
<h3 id="rotation"><a class="header" href="#rotation">Rotation</a></h3>
<p>If you click the curved arrow, the table will be rotated clockwise,
unless you have the shift key held down when you click it. If you have
the shift key held down and you click the curved arrow, the table will
rotate counter-clockwise.</p>
<h3 id="audio-1"><a class="header" href="#audio-1">Audio</a></h3>
<p>You can click on the bell icon to adjust whether or not certain sounds
are played at this table. You have more control of which sounds are
played in the <a href="tables/../lobby/preferences.html">Preferences dialog</a>
available from the Lobby.</p>
<h3 id="game-notification"><a class="header" href="#game-notification">Game Notification</a></h3>
<p>The circled exclamation point is similar to the bell, but it changes
which game and/or level notifications you get.</p>
<h3 id="deck-color"><a class="header" href="#deck-color">Deck Color</a></h3>
<p>The paint bucket allows you to change whether to use a normal two-color
(diamonds and hearts are red, clubs and spades are black) deck or a
four-color deck (clubs are green, diamonds are blue, hearts are red and
spades are black).</p>
<p>If you hold the shift key down when you click on the paint bucket, you
change the color of the back of the cards.</p>
<h3 id="messages-to-display"><a class="header" href="#messages-to-display">Messages to Display</a></h3>
<p>Clicking on the &quot;quotation box&quot; icon allows you to adjust what messages show
up in your chat-box (or chat-window if you Pop-out your chat).</p>
<h3 id="number-of-observers"><a class="header" href="#number-of-observers">Number of Observers</a></h3>
<p>Clicking on the star icon allows you to see how many people are
watching your table and how many non-players are watching you in
specific. People who are logged in can watch your table by clicking on
the table number in the lobby.  When you're playing, <a href="tables/./shareable-urls.html">your URL is
shareable</a>. If you share your URL and someone
follows that link, that person is watching <em>you</em> play, meaning if you
get sent to another table, they will automatically be switched to
watching that table, too.</p>
<p>After you click on the star, you get something that looks like <code>T: 0, P: 0</code> where the number after the <code>T:</code> is the number of people watching
your table and the number after the <code>P:</code> is the number of people
watching you, the player.</p>
<p>Observers are only counted while they have a table window open.  So if
you share your URL with ten people and three of them start watching at
the same time, you'll get <code>P: 3</code>, which will increase if anyone else
follows that link before any of the original three close their window.</p>
<p>Although it hasn't been properly load-tested yet, mb2 is designed to
support tens of thousands and eventually hundreds of players and/or
observers efficiently.  During pre-alpha testing it is unlikely that
we'll overload the server, although it could happen if someone with a
huge social network shares a URL.  If that happens, I'll make
load-testing and bandwidth limiting an exceedingly high priority.
Otherwise, I'll try to get it done before it's needed.</p>
<h3 id="optional-scroll-to-the-bottom"><a class="header" href="#optional-scroll-to-the-bottom"><em>Optional</em> Scroll to the Bottom</a></h3>
<p>When there are too many lines to display in the chat-box or
chat-window, a scroll-bar is presented. If you scroll backward, a
down-arrow appears.  The down-arrow is black when it's not your turn
to act and red when it is.  If you click on the down-arrow it
immediately scrolls forward so that the bottom (most recent) message
is visible.</p>
<h3 id="optional-hands-remaining"><a class="header" href="#optional-hands-remaining"><em>Optional</em> Hands Remaining</a></h3>
<p>Which games are played in a tournament are determined by the
tournament's <a href="tables/../tournaments/structure.html">structure</a>.</p>
<p>Some
tournament structures only have a single game in them (e.g. a No-Limit
Hold'em tournament). Others are mixes, like <strong>HORSE</strong> (<strong>H</strong>old'em,
<strong>O</strong>maha, <strong>R</strong>azz, <strong>S</strong>tud, Stud/<strong>E</strong>ight).</p>
<p>However, tournament structures have two different ways to determine when
to change game</p>
<ul>
<li>by a count (<strong>HORSE</strong> is by count)</li>
<li>by level (TOC-style is by level)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are playing on a table where the game is going to change via a
count, the last button on the top-line can tell you how many times
more the current game will be played after the current hand completes.
If you don't want to see that that information (perhaps you're teaching
yourself how to count to six), you can click it and the button will
remain, but the number won't be shown.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="advanced-checkboxes"><a class="header" href="#advanced-checkboxes">Advanced Checkboxes</a></h1>
<p>In general, checkboxes are used to select choices before it's your turn to
act.  If you have bad cards and you know you're going to fold when it
is your turn, you can click on a <code>Fold</code> checkbox. If you change your mind
before it becomes your turn you can simply uncheck the checkbox.</p>
<p>Many of the checkboxes act like &quot;radio buttons&quot; do in other interfaces. If
you check <code>Fold</code> and then check <code>Call Any</code>, the <code>Fold</code> checkbox will
automatically be unchecked.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="immediate-buttons"><a class="header" href="#immediate-buttons">Immediate Buttons</a></h1>
<p>When it is your turn to act, if you have not previously specified a valid
advanced action, you'll be presented with buttons that represent what you
can do. Unlike checkboxes, you can't change your mind once you click a
button.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="shareable-urls"><a class="header" href="#shareable-urls">Shareable URLs</a></h1>
<p>When you are at a table, the URL in the location portion of your
table's windowframe is a URL that you can share with people.  People
who visit the URL can watch the game (if there's still something to
watch).</p>
<p>For example, the URL
<a href="https://devctm.com/event/3076/player/10">https://devctm.com/event/3076/player/10</a>
was from a tournament on February 22nd, 2022. Specifically, that was
deadhead's (player #10) URL. The tournament started at 5:05 Pacific
and deadhead bust at 6:15 Pacific, so if anyone had visited that URL
between when the tournament started and when deadhead bust, that
person would have seen the game playing in real time.</p>
<p>If a URL includes a player, then it is player-specific and the
observer will automatically follow the player if the player is
assigned to a different table.</p>
<p>If a URL is visited after the player has bust or won, a summary of the
event will be displayed. E.g.,</p>
<p><img src="tables/./deadhead-fsatg.png" alt="Deadhead Bust" title="Deadhead is not good at this game" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="review-button"><a class="header" href="#review-button">Review Button</a></h1>
<p>Clicking the review button brings up a pane in the lower left corner of the
table window. That pane shows the ending of the previous hand: players' hole
cards (unless they mucked) and the hand they made.</p>
<p>The winning &quot;high&quot;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> hands are in green (and bold, so color-blind
people can recognize them).  The winning &quot;low&quot; hands are in blue (and
italics). If you mouse over a high or low label that has won chips from
a pot, the amount won is displayed as a &quot;tooltip&quot;. If there are multiple
pots (due to one or more players being all-in), the amounts won from each
pot are shown.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Some games split the pot with two different high hands, e.g., Dramaha,
where one high hand is made using the board and the other high hand is made
using solely the player's hole cards. In games like these, one of the two
high hands gets the extra chip if there is one. It's the high hand that
gets the extra chip that will be in green and bold.</p>
</div>

<p>Mb2 &quot;keeps score&quot; by tracking &quot;Fun Money&quot;, an abstraction of what a
real life poker player spends and perhaps wins while playing poker.</p>
<h2 id="no-intrinsic-value"><a class="header" href="#no-intrinsic-value">No Intrinsic Value</a></h2>
<p>Mb2 keeps track of how much Fun Money you spend and win.  It's a point
system that helps keep the playing of virtual poker fun and challenging.
Although it has no intrinsic worth, players are encouraged to take it
semi-seriously, because, for mb2's intended player-base, playing with
people who are all taking it semi-seriously is more fun!</p>
<h2 id="you-start-with-zero-but"><a class="header" href="#you-start-with-zero-but">You start with Zero, but…</a></h2>
<p>When you create an mb2 account, you start with no Fun Money. However, most

<p>Mb2 is currently tournament-centric.  This is mostly a side-effect of
tournaments being more complicated than <a href="./ring_games.html">ring games</a>.
Sometimes when creating a new architecture for a software project, it
makes sense to implement the more complicated parts first, especially
if the less complicated parts are in some sense a subset of more
complicated ones.</p>

<p>Some of the information for a structure is available from the list of
tournaments available in the lobby. Some of the other information is
hidden, solely because nobody has written a nice UI to reveal that
information.</p>
<p>You can not currently define your own structures, but mb2 has well over
a hundred structures &quot;baked in.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="examples"><a class="header" href="#examples">Examples</a></h3>
<p>You can see example structure sheets in the <a href="tournaments/../barge/structures.html">*ARGE Structures</a> section of
this manual.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="payouts"><a class="header" href="#payouts">Payouts</a></h1>
<p>Currently all tournaments with a buy-in pay out via the <a href="tournaments/../barge/payouts.html">BARGE Unified
Payout Schedule</a>.  The size of the payout pool
is the sum of all of the buy-ins minus any amount reserved for bounties.
Currently, in rebuy and/or add-on tournaments, none of the rebuy or add-on
buy-in goes into the prize pool.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="series"><a class="header" href="#series">Series</a></h1>
<p>A group of tournaments can be bound into a series by an
administrator. There is currently no administrative user-interface, so
series are relatively rare.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="historical"><a class="header" href="#historical">Historical</a></h1>
<p>The first four were put together and run in 2020 and early 2021 as
substitutes for the normally-in-a-casino BARGE, FARGO, ATLARGE and
EMBARGO events. Each of those four series were private. In order to
even see the tournaments in the lobby, a player needed to be
authorized.</p>
<p>Although not nearly as much fun as meeting in person, the substitute
series were fun and well-received. However, they're in the past and
there's not much point to documenting them in this book.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="wsop-style-2022"><a class="header" href="#wsop-style-2022">WSOP-Style 2022</a></h1>
<h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The WSOP-Style 2022 Series consists of a tournament a day from
Saturday, June 11th through Sunday, June 3rd, 2002.  Each tournament starts
at 3pm Pacific time (6pm Eastern).</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues/183">no late
entry</a>. Additionally,
instead of re-entries, the tournaments uses rebuys.  The difference
being that rebuys happen immediately after you bust and you retain the
seat that you were busted in.  So, if the structure sheet says the
tournament supports two re-entries through level 15, you will be
allowed (but not required) to rebuy up to twice, but only through
level 15.</p>
<p>This series is open to the public.  Tell others.  Although there's
still a lot of room for improvement, the user interface should be
usable by anyone who already has some online or cardroom poker
experience .</p>
<h2 id="tournament-length"><a class="header" href="#tournament-length">Tournament Length</a></h2>
<p>Each of the WSOPS tournaments starts with the same five minute round
duration parameter that is used for mb2's evening and night
tournament.  With a dozen players the evening and night tournaments
have typically finished in an hour and a half.</p>
<p>If we get enough players, I'll <a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues/969">add the ability to put a soft two-hour
limit</a> on the tournaments.
It will work by looking at the number of players that are signed up when
the tournament starts, estimating how long it will take to finish with
five minute rounds and if that estimate is over two hours, it makes
the rounds shorter so that the estimate is two hours.  As such, even
if this series grows larger than the evening and nightly tournaments,
the overall tournament duration for the winner shouldn't ever be much
more than two hours.</p>
<h2 id="prize-for-first-place"><a class="header" href="#prize-for-first-place">Prize for first place</a></h2>
<p>Craft Poker Co. will provide a physical prize to the winner of each
tournament in the series. The prize will be an <a href="https://www.trophies2go.com/engraved-rettangolo-glass-paperweight.html">Engraved Rectangular
Glass
Paperweight</a>
unless they run out or other unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>There will <em>probably</em> also be nicer prizes for the top three
leaderboard at the end of the series, but nothing has been finalized yet.</p>
<h2 id="leaderboard"><a class="header" href="#leaderboard">Leaderboard</a></h2>
<p>Mb2 knows which tournaments belong to this series and there is a
&quot;WSOPS Leaderboard&quot; available from the lobby.</p>
<p>The leaderboard tracks <a href="series/../fun_money.html">Fun Money</a>.  Each of the tournaments
has an FM 200 buy-in and Fun Money is awarded using the <a href="series/../barge/payouts.html">BARGE Unified Payout
Schedule</a>. All rebuys are for FM 200 each and all of
the Fun Money from rebuys goes directly into the prize pool,</p>
<h2 id="synchronized-breaks-1"><a class="header" href="#synchronized-breaks-1">Synchronized Breaks</a></h2>
<p>Each tournament is run with synchronized breaks, meaning when the time
of day is fifty-five minutes past the hour, at the end of the hand
each table will pause. Once all tables are paused, there will be a
five minute break after which all the tables will resume
simultaneously.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ring-games"><a class="header" href="#ring-games">Ring Games</a></h1>
<p>Ring games, also known as cash games (even though no cash is involved),
are the non-tournament form of poker.</p>
<p>In a Ring Game, you choose how much of your Fun Money you want to
bring to the table, where it's converted to chips.  You then play at
the table as long as you want and when you leave your chips are converted
back to Fun Money. If you gain chips at the table, then when you leave
you'll have gained Fun Money, but if you lose chips at the table, the
net effect will be that you lost Fun Money.</p>
<h2 id="not-supported-yet"><a class="header" href="#not-supported-yet">Not Supported Yet</a></h2>
<p>Although there's a brief description of Ring Games here and a few
mentions of them elsewhere in this Players' Manual, Ring Games are
currently unsupported.  The server knows a bit—but definitely
not all—about Ring Games but the client knows very little.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="vacation"><a class="header" href="#vacation">Vacation</a></h1>
<h2 id="turn-based"><a class="header" href="#turn-based">Turn Based</a></h2>
<p>Poker is turn-based. All poker games have at least one round of
betting where players with uncommitted chips must act, e.g., fold,
call, bet or raise.  Some poker games also have rounds where cards are
&quot;manipulated&quot; (for want of a better term), e.g. discarded or exchanged
for new cards.</p>
<p>Although action and manipulation is done in a specific order, in most
cases the user interface allows a player to tell the server how that
player wants to act or manipulate in advance. When it is a players
turn to act or manipulate, if that player has a valid advanced request
pending, it is used.</p>
<h2 id="being-put-on-vacation"><a class="header" href="#being-put-on-vacation">Being Put On Vacation</a></h2>
<p>If it is a player's turn and that player doesn't have an advanced request,
a timer is started and that player must do whatever is required for
that turn before the timer runs out our that payer is put on vacation.</p>
<p>If a player is put on vacation when it is a player's time to act, that
player will check if checking is an option. If checking is not an option,
that player will fold.</p>
<p>If a player is put on vacation when it is a player's time to manipulate
the player's cards, the minimal manipulation possible will be done.  For
example, if a player has the option of standing pat (i.e. not discarding
or exchanging any cards), that' what the player will do.  However, if a
player must discard a card, the server will choose a card to discard.</p>
<h3 id="how-the-server-decides-which-cards-to-manipulate"><a class="header" href="#how-the-server-decides-which-cards-to-manipulate">How the Server Decides Which Cards to Manipulate</a></h3>
<p>If the server has to choose a card for manipulation, it will not take
the rank or suit or other cards into consideration. In other words,
the server will not try to make a good choice for you, nor will it try
to make a bad choice for you.</p>
<h2 id="a-vacationed-player-may-win-a-hand"><a class="header" href="#a-vacationed-player-may-win-a-hand">A Vacationed Player May Win a Hand</a></h2>
<p>It is possible for a player to win a hand on vacation, but only if the
player starts the hand not on vacation.  The act of being put on
vacation doesn't fold a player, so if a player is put on vacation and
can check for the rest of the hand, that player's hand will still be
live at the showdown.</p>
<h2 id="starting-on-vacation"><a class="header" href="#starting-on-vacation">Starting On Vacation</a></h2>
<p>If, however, a player starts a hand on vacation, that player's hand will
be folded before showdown.</p>
<h2 id="no-show"><a class="header" href="#no-show">No Show</a></h2>
<p>In a tournament, if a player goes on vacation before acting or
manipulating, that player is considered a no-show until that player
does act or manipulate.  While a player is considered a no-show, the
player's hand will be folded before the first round of action or
manipulation.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chat"><a class="header" href="#chat">Chat</a></h1>
<p>The lobby and the table windows allow you to type messages.</p>
<p>Messages typed in the lobby can be seen by anyone logged in or anyone
who logs in in the next twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Lobby chat can sometimes be a bit confusing because there may be a big
lag between when someone asks a question and someone else responds.
As such, the original question will no longer appear once it times
out, which could leave an answer stranded. For this reason, lobby chat
messages have timestamps that can be seen by hovering over the chat
line.</p>
<p>Messages typed in tables can be seen by anyone playing at or
observing those tables.  Observers can be logged in or anonymous.</p>
<p>All chat is preceded by the nickname of the author of the chat. Normal
messages then have a colon before the message. Action messages do not
have the colon.</p>
<h2 id="special-formatting"><a class="header" href="#special-formatting">Special Formatting</a></h2>
<h3 id="action-messages"><a class="header" href="#action-messages">Action Messages</a></h3>
<p>If you preface your message with &quot;/me &quot;, your message will be
displayed in italics.  E.g., if I type </p>
<blockquote>
<p>/me applauds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the output will be </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>deadhead applauds</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="links"><a class="header" href="#links">Links</a></h3>
<p>You can create a link that other people can click on by surrounding the
label for the link in <code>[]</code> and then, with no space after the closing <code>]</code>,
putting the complete URL within <code>()</code>.  E.g., if I type</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Craft Poker Co. is [now online](https://craftpoker.com/).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the output will be</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Craft Poker Co. is <a href="https://craftpoker.com/">now online</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only URLs that start with <code>http://</code>, <code>https://</code> or <code>mailto:</code> can be
used inside the parentheses. If the text inside the parentheses doesn't
start with those schemes or is not a valid URL, then mb2 will simply
pass the text through, so if you type</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[test](link)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the output will be</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[test](link)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At some point <a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues/907">mb2 will detect failed attempts at
links</a>, but that's not yet
a high priority.</p>
<h3 id="emojis"><a class="header" href="#emojis">Emojis</a></h3>
<p>You can either type (or paste) emojis in as utf-8 or you can use <a href="https://emojipedia.org/github/">GitHub
emoji shortcodes</a>, but only for the GitHub
emojis that have a Unicode representation<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.  E.g., if I
type</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yup! I hit my two outer. :grinning:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the output will be</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yup! I hit my two outer. 😀</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Unfortunately, I know of no nicely structured list of that GitHub
emoji subset and the <a href="https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908">gist that shows <em>all</em> GitHub emoji
shortcodes</a> leads with
:bowtie: which <em>does not</em> have a Unicode representation. Luckily,
the vast majority of the emojis in that list are indeed represented
by Unicode.</p>
</div>
<p>Additionally, if you want to use that list, you might be able to tell
whether a particular emoji has a Unicode representation by hovering
your mouse over the emoji. Try doing that with the bowtie emoji and
almost any other emoji on that page and you may see that your cursor
turns to an I-beam for emojis with a Unicode representation (e.g.,
:smile:) but remains an arrow for one of the ones that doesn't work
(e.g., :bowtie:).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="games"><a class="header" href="#games">Games</a></h1>
<p>Mb2 can deal over fifty different variations of poker<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. This includes
common ones like Texas Hold'em, Omaha and Seven Card Stud as well as
lesser known games like Badugi, Courchevel and Big O.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ceemeck.org/BARGERuleBook2021/">BARGE Rule Book</a> has
rules to almost all of the games mb2 deals.  The exceptions are
<a href="./games/sack.html">Sack</a>, <a href="./games/wonky-donkey.html">Wonky Donkey</a>,
<a href="./games/rio-bravo.html">Rio Bravo</a> and <a href="./games/redrum.html">Redrum</a>.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>At the time of this writing, the precise—but perhaps inaccurate—number of games is fifty-six. That number comes from the source code to mb2:</p>
<pre><code>pub static GAMES: Lazy&lt;[GameInfo; 56]&gt; = Lazy::new(|| {
    [
        // Hold'ems
        (&amp;*HOLD_EM).into(),
        (&amp;*IRISH).into(),
        (&amp;*HOLD_EM_SHORT).into(),
        (&amp;*CRAZY_PINE_8).into(),
        (&amp;*HOLDEM_8).into(),
        (&amp;*LAZY_PINE).into(),
        (&amp;*LAZY_PINE_8).into(),
...
</code></pre>
<p>The 56 shows that we're populating the <code>GAMES</code> constant with 56
elements, but it's counting <code>Hold'em</code> and <code>Hold'em High/Low with an Eight Qualifier</code> as two separate games.</p>
</div>
<p>It's also making the distinction between <code>Crazy Pineapple</code> and <code>Lazy Pineapple</code>, yet collectively those <em>two</em> games count as <em>three</em> (and
not four!) because it has a separate entry for Lazy Pineapple with an
eight qualifier and Lazy Pineapple without an eight qualifier, but
does not do the same for Crazy Pineapple.</p>
<p>Internally, games are implemented as core games<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> which can have a lot
of options applied to them and the <code>GAMES</code> constant simply represents
the most popular combinations of core games with options. There is no
requirement for a combination of a core game and options to be present
in <code>GAMES</code> for that combination to be used in a tournament structure
or ring game, so mb2 is already dealing more than fifty-six different
variants, but some of the differences are so small that it's hard to
argue they're different games.</p>
<p><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>
At the time of this writing, here are the core games, with up to three
examples of each.  This table is mostly to represent the current flexibility
of mb2. As such, it's not really that useful to Players, per-se.</p>

<p>In addition to the information here, <a href="https://www.ceemeck.org/BARGERuleBook2021/other.html#mexican-poker">Mexican
Poker</a>
is now included in the BARGE Rule Book.</p>
<p>Another set of rules for Mexican Poker are
<a href="https://www.thebike.com/play/poker_mexican_poker.php">those at The Bicycle</a>.
The
<a href="https://poker.fandom.com/wiki/Mexican_Poker">ones at Poker Fandom</a>
aren't bad except they incorrectly claim that the lowest up-card is the
bring-in (The Bicycle rules get that right).  Additionally, the
<a href="https://www.wsop.com/2019/2019%20WSOP%20Live%20Action%20Rules%20(FINAL).pdf">WSOP 2019 document</a>
also has their explanation (although you'll have to search for &quot;Mexican
Poker&quot; to find them).</p>
<p>The big things to know about Mexican Poker on mb2 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Up and Down buttons refer to how you want your next card dealt</li>
<li>Mb2 does not <em>visually</em> discriminate between a down-dealt and an up-dealt joker</li>
</ul>
<p>Mb2 does recognize that a down-dealt joker is wild, even if it's
subsequently turned up.  So, the right thing will happen, but there's
currently no visual representation reminding you the state of the
joker.  This can be trivially fixed, but it requires someone to create
assets and we haven't yet requested anyone to create them, since the
current interface will be going away &quot;soon&quot;.</p>

<p>Wonky Donkey is either Hold'em or Omaha/8, but which one it is isn't
known until after the flop.  Each player gets dealt two face-down
hole cards and then there's a betting round. After that, a three card
flop is dealt.</p>
<p>If two or three of the flop cards are <span
style="color:red">red</span>, the game proceeds as Hold'em.</p>
<p>If two or three of the flop cards are <strong>black</strong>, each payer is dealt
two additional face-down hole cards (before the post-flop betting
begins) and the game proceeds as Omaha Hi/Low Split with an Eight
Qualifier.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rio-bravo"><a class="header" href="#rio-bravo">Rio Bravo</a></h1>
<p>Rio Bravo is Hold'em, except after the river betting, each live player
is dealt a third face-down hole card and then there's a final (fifth)
round of betting.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="redrum"><a class="header" href="#redrum">Redrum</a></h1>
<p>Redrum is

where the low is deuce-to-seven style and there's no qualifier but the
high has a Full House of Fives or higher qualifier.  Its origins are
unclear, but there was probably drinking involved.</p>
<p>Redrum is not well play-balanced.  It is either a failed experiment or
a stalled experiment.  Perhaps the rules will be tweaked in the future

<p>This section of the Players' Manual is devoted to little things that

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lammers"><a class="header" href="#lammers">Lammers</a></h1>
<p>Some of the tournament structures (typically limited to big-bet)
include lammers in addition to starting chips.  Each lammer is worth a
fixed amount and can be used in four different ways:</p>
<h3 id="redemption-before-the-first-hand"><a class="header" href="#redemption-before-the-first-hand">Redemption Before the First Hand</a></h3>
<p>If you want to redeem any of your lammers before the first hand, you
must use the &quot;extra options&quot; menu from the lobby that's the rightmost
column in the upcoming tournaments area.  The leftmost column is the
check-box that you use to join.  The rightmost column is a down
chevron that has a drop-down menu associated with it.  When a
tournament uses lammers, that drop-down allows you to specify how many
of the lammers you want to redeem before the start of the first hand.</p>
<h3 id="manual-redemption-during-the-game"><a class="header" href="#manual-redemption-during-the-game">Manual Redemption During The Game</a></h3>
<p>The redeem command (requires use of the command text box) takes a
single numeric argument that specifies how many lammers you wish to
redeem (e.g., <code>redeem 2</code>).</p>
<p>If you are in a hand, the redemption will happen at the end of that
hand.  If you have a redemption scheduled for the end of the hand and
you change your mind you can use <code>redeem 0</code>.</p>
<p>If you're not in a hand, the redemption will happen immediately and can
not be reverted.</p>
<h3 id="resurrection"><a class="header" href="#resurrection">Resurrection</a></h3>
<p>If you bust and you have one or more lammers left, exactly one lammer
will be cashed in and you'll be back in the game with the amount of
chips that lammer is worth.</p>
<h3 id="forced-redemption"><a class="header" href="#forced-redemption">Forced Redemption</a></h3>
<p>Typically there's a final level where lammers are allowed and if you
finish that level, all lammers you have are redeemed for you (and all
your opponents) automatically.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="github"><a class="header" href="#github">GitHub</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/about">GitHub</a> is a wonderful service for
programmers, but if you don't already know what it is, you <em>probably</em>
don't want to join it just to use your GitHub account to log in to
Mb2, but you can if you want.</p>
<p>Mb2 currently supports signing-on (and signing-up) via GitHub as a
proof-of-concept for allowing logging in through social media.  GitHub
was chosen to be first because Mb2's user interface currently is
&quot;sub-optimal&quot; (<code>/me chuckles</code>) and as such the next tranche to be
exposed to Mb2 are likely to be people who can look beyond the
surface, e.g., programmers.</p>
<p>If you sign-in via GitHub, your account's canonical name will be your
GitHub account's name canonicalized. You can customize your nickname by
putting the customization in the <code>Nickname</code> field of the sign-up and then
clicking the <code>Login with GitHub</code> button. Your customization will only
be accepted if it is compatible with your canonicalized name.</p>
<p>As an example of customization, if your GitHub account name is <code>ctm</code> and
you put <code>Ctm!</code> in the <code>Nickname</code> field, then when you're logged in, your
nickname will be <code>Ctm!</code>. If, however, you put <code>deadhead</code> in the <code>Nickname</code>
field, then your nickname will simply be the unadorned <code>ctm</code>.</p>
<p>FWIW, GitHub hosts the <a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/tree/master/src">source to this Player's
Manual</a>, this Player's
Manual itself, <a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues">Mb2's issue
tracker</a> and the source to mb2
(in a private repository).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="table-balancing"><a class="header" href="#table-balancing">Table Balancing</a></h1>
<p>When there are three or more tables in a tournament, mb2 will keep the
player counts of each table within two of each other. It will do this
by moving one player at the end of the hand from a table that has more
than two more players than the smallest table.  The player that is
moved will be the player that has the worst position (e.g., about to
take the big blind). That player will be moved into the worst
position.  As such, that player will not move into a worse position
than that player would have been in anyway.</p>
<p>When there are enough empty seats to accommodate all the players in the
smallest table, that table will be broken. The players at the broken
table will be assigned to other tables at random.</p>
<p>When there are two tables, mb2 will keep the player counts of each of the
two tables within one of each other.  It will rebalance the same way
that is done when there are more than two tables.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sevens-rule"><a class="header" href="#sevens-rule">Sevens Rule</a></h1>
<h2 id="sevens-rule-definition"><a class="header" href="#sevens-rule-definition">Sevens Rule Definition</a></h2>
<p>The Sevens Rule applies only to California Lowball. It is simply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the draw, if you have a seven or better, you may not check it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the purposes of the Sevens Rule, calling an amount that is less
than the post-draw bet size is considered a check. The only way that
can happen is if the first player to bet goes all-in for less than the
post-draw bet size.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="penalty"><a class="header" href="#penalty">Penalty</a></h1>
<h2 id="sevens-rule-penalty"><a class="header" href="#sevens-rule-penalty">Sevens Rule Penalty</a></h2>
<p>The penalty is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After violating the Sevens Rule, further action from that player,
for the remainder of that hand, will be lost or returned. It will
never increase the amount to be won above the amount to be won
pre-violation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a player checks a seven and subsequently folds or loses the hand,
there is no penalty, because that player would not win anything
anyway.</p>
<p>However, if a player checks a seven, post-draw, and shows the best
hand, all of that player's post-check action is returned to the
player.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if no other hand tied the best hand shown by the
violator, then everyone's action beyond that check, from any pot that
includes that hand, is returned.</p>
<p>If there is a tie between one or more Sevens Rule violators and one or
more Sevens Rule followers, the post-draw action of the Sevens Rule
violators is returned to the violators and the remaining amount in the
pot is awarded to the non-violator (or split evenly if more than one
non-violator has a tying winning hand).</p>

<p>The BARGE Rule Book has an <a href="https://www.ceemeck.org/BARGERuleBook2021/the-sevens-rule.html">elaborate

<p>BARGE stands for the Big August Rec.Gambling Excursion.  It's an event
that's been held annually since 1990.</p>
<p>You don't need to know anything about BARGE to use mb2, but BARGE and
BARGErs have strongly influenced mb2.  It is no coincidence that
almost all the games mb2 currently knows how to deal occur in the
<a href="barge/rule_book.html">BARGE Rule Book</a>.</p>
<p>In 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, BARGE was held online using an
incredibly primitive version of mb2. So far, <a href="https://www.barge.org/barge-2020">those
tournaments</a> are the largest ones
mb2 has dealt to actual people.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="barge-rule-book"><a class="header" href="#barge-rule-book">BARGE Rule Book</a></h1>
<p>Written by BARGE's very own Christopher J. Mecklin, the BARGE Rule
Book is updated annually to contain all the games to be played in the
BARGE tournaments, with games from previous years moved to a different

<p>Here's an incomplete, semi-chronoligical list of people (and one band)
who have, in some way contributed to the birth of mb2.  I'm sure there
are very important people whom I've left out.  I'll add them as I
think of them.  If you're one of them, let me know.</p>
<p>I am not attempting to thank everyone who has helped my life in
general.  I've been blessed by having great parents, friends,
teachers, professors, clients and doctors, all of whom have allowed me
to live a charmed life. However, the people mentioned here <em>directly</em>

<p>My older sister Marcia took me to see the <a href="https://archive.org/details/gd1979-01-15.all.aud-rolfe.127556.flac1644">Grateful Dead on January
15th, 1979</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-grateful-dead"><a class="header" href="#the-grateful-dead">the Grateful Dead</a></h3>
<p>During my college years I had the time, money and inclination to go
see the Grateful Dead play in many different venues. Some of their
songs (e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhaBtdN_GQk">Deal</a> and
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWIIQ-FO8ic">Loser</a>) involve
gambling, both metaphorically and actually playing poker.</p>
<p>On March 26th, 1983 the Grateful Dead <a href="https://archive.org/details/gd1983-03-26.140315.sbd.eaton.miller.clugston.flac1648">played Las
Vegas</a>.
I drove out to see them.  I had a great time and wound up fascinated
by the video poker machine in the Best Western.  So, once I got back to
Albuquerque, I wrote my own video poker software.</p>

<p>I do not remember whether I found IRC poker before or after I found Roy's
C library for evaluating poker hands, but they both were a pleasant
distraction from the Macintosh emulation and reverse engineering that
occupied the vast majority of my time in the early nineties.</p>
<h2 id="hand-evaluators"><a class="header" href="#hand-evaluators">Hand Evaluators</a></h2>
<h3 id="roy-hashimoto"><a class="header" href="#roy-hashimoto">Roy Hashimoto</a></h3>
<p>Roy wrote C software to evaluate poker hands and to iterate through a deck
to compute various odds.  I, and others, found various ways to speed up
Roy's code.</p>
<h3 id="mat-hostetter"><a class="header" href="#mat-hostetter">Mat Hostetter</a></h3>
<p>Mat observed that there was a lot of information to be gained by
viewing a hand as four 13-bit numbers (each 13-bit number
representing the ranks present for each of the four suits) and then
doing a bitwise-or of those four numbers. With Hostetter's Observation
he was able to code up what was the fastest hand evaluator at the
time.  I did some of the grunt work.</p>
<h3 id="steve-brecher"><a class="header" href="#steve-brecher">Steve Brecher</a></h3>

<p>Andrew took on and conquered some of the combinatorical explosions

such odds.</p>

<p>In 1994, I attended my first <a href="https://www.barge.org/">BARGE</a>. The organizers
did an excellent job putting the event together and my fellow BARGErs were

<p>Michael attended his first BARGE in 1992 when it was still
semi-spontaneous.  Chuck's first was 1993.</p>
<p>Since 1994 was my first BARGE, and since BARGE would come to be a
minor influence on multibot and a huge influence on mb2, these two
organizers get explicit thanks here.  Michael and Chuck have also
been playing on mb2 since the early days and are two of the most
frequent players.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="multibot"><a class="header" href="#multibot">Multibot</a></h1>
<p>Todd's server did not (initially?) deal tournaments, but, if I
remember correctly, some of us chose to create the tournament
experience by starting at a table and raising the blinds as we played.
There were many drawbacks to these (up to 23-players for Hold'em)
tounaments.</p>
<p>On Halloween 1998, I wrote the core of &quot;multibot&quot;, an IRC bot to deal
multi-table tournaments.  I did it on Halloweeen because I knew that the
constant interruption from trick-or-treaters would preclude me from doing
Macintosh emulation work that required serious concentration.</p>
<p>Although multibot's core was initially in C, I soon rewrote multibot
in Objective-C, a language that I had to use to port
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executor_(software)">Executor</a> to
NeXTSTEP.  I wound up liking Objective-C and used multibot as a
vehicle to help me learn it better.</p>
<h2 id="i-needed-money"><a class="header" href="#i-needed-money">I needed money</a></h2>
<p>I had planned on making multibot open source, but I had a loan that I
I needed to pay back.</p>

<p>I don't want to encourage addiction.  I've heard about it from a developer
and seen it in players.</p>
<h3 id="anonymous-mmo-developer"><a class="header" href="#anonymous-mmo-developer">Anonymous MMO developer</a></h3>
<p>A friend of mine was a lead developer on an MMO.  Well after the MMO
was released, he heard from several people that they had spent way too
much time on that MMO. It was sufficiently addicting that they felt
they had lost far too much their life and somehow he was to blame.</p>
<h3 id="anonymous-mmo-players"><a class="header" href="#anonymous-mmo-players">Anonymous MMO players</a></h3>
<p>A couple other friends of mine got very active in an MMO and…
eventually decided that they had wasted months, if not years, of their
time due to the addictiveness of this game.</p>
<h2 id="rust-is-an-awesome-language"><a class="header" href="#rust-is-an-awesome-language">Rust is an awesome language</a></h2>
<p>I read a lot of good things about Rust and eventually I started
dabbling in it.  Eventually I started thinking about writing another
poker server.  By then Poker School Online had been bought by Poker
Stars and my software had been completely decommissioned, so I wouldn't
be competing with the people who bought multibot.</p>
<p>The more I played with Rust the more I wanted to learn (although to be
fair, there were days when Rust's steep learning curve was pretty
intimidating).</p>
<h2 id="my-daughters-liked-to-play-poker"><a class="header" href="#my-daughters-liked-to-play-poker">My daughters liked to play poker</a></h2>
<p>My wife and I used a bunch of the money I got from Poker School Online
to go through five rounds of in-vitro conception, resulting in three
children.  As they grew, I spent a little time playing an MMO with my
eldest: my son Elvis. For some reason my daughters enjoyed (at least
briefly) playing poker with me with real cards and cheap chips.</p>
<h3 id="margaret-and-iris"><a class="header" href="#margaret-and-iris">Margaret and Iris</a></h3>
<p>So, being terminally lazy—and wanting to learn Rust—I decided
to write software to deal poker rather than having to get out, play with
and put away actual cards and chips.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mb2"><a class="header" href="#mb2">Mb2</a></h1>
<p>Mb2 is my successor to multibot. The thought of creating a new poker ecosystem
rumbled around in my head for a while. In 2019, three days after running
the Boston Marathon, I pulled the trigger:</p>

<h3 id="barge-deadheads"><a class="header" href="#barge-deadheads">BARGE deadheads</a></h3>
<p>On May 7th, I shared my thoughts, concerns and need for play-testers
with the BARGE deadheads. I sent out an email with &quot;return, maybe, of
IRC poker, sort of&quot; as the subject and I got great feedback.</p>
<h3 id="wrgpt"><a class="header" href="#wrgpt"><a href="http://wrgpt.org/">WRGPT</a></a></h3>
<p>Although I knew how to play poker and have written a poker server
before, I knew that I might forget various edge cases, so one of the
first things I did was write a parser to allow me to read all the hand
histories from the most recent WRGPT.</p>
<p>I had wanted to do the same using IRC poker histories, but I couldn't
find any.  I wasn't even successful at finding documentation for the
IRC poker commands, so I leaned on the WRGPT advanced action documentation
when my memory was insufficient as I created mb2's underlying protocol.</p>
<h3 id="bill-savage"><a class="header" href="#bill-savage">Bill Savage</a></h3>
<p>In mid October, 2019, one of my friends volunteered to invest in my
project.  I've known Bill for a long time.  We used to follow the
Grateful Dead, often with him driving.  He was also my hiking partner
for many years.  He was around back when I formed Abacus Research &amp;
Development (my Macintosh emulation and reverse engineering company).</p>
<h3 id="lfromhell"><a class="header" href="#lfromhell">LFromHell</a></h3>
<p>The earliest version of mb2 used IRC as an interface and LFromHell was
essentially my only play-tester.  Others stepped in and tried it here and
there, but she came out regularly and even brought a friend or two.  Her
early support was critical to me getting mb2 off the ground.</p>

<p>Similarly, I wanted mb2 to be able to support a variety of tournament
structures, so I implemented the most recent tournament structures
dealt at BARGE and EMBARGO. They were created by Rich Bremer.</p>
<h3 id="lee-ward"><a class="header" href="#lee-ward">Lee Ward</a></h3>
<p>In mid August, 2020, another of my friends volunteered to invest in my
project.  Like Bill, I've known him since I was in the UNM MSCS
program.  So he too was around for the birth and death of ARDI (Abacus
Research &amp; Development).  What a long, strange trip it's been.</p>

<p>Patrick created mb2's deck.</p>
<h3 id="charles-haynes"><a class="header" href="#charles-haynes">Charles Haynes</a></h3>
<p>In mid May, 2021, I sought and found a third investor. Charles
got the deal via a simple reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I'm in.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ironically, as of mid March 2022, I haven't yet taken Charles's
money, because it's taken me a while (<em>far too long</em>) to
find a business attorney and to get various preferred shareholder
agreements written.  Since Charles can back out once the
paperwork is ready, that succinct reply has turned into (IMO) a big
freeroll.</p>

<p>Back when mb2 was still text only, Gerry started playing in our daily
tournaments. There have been other players who have played quite a
bit, but Gerry has been a constant presence and has provided many
good suggestions.</p>
<h3 id="nnr13"><a class="header" href="#nnr13">NNR13</a></h3>
<p>NNR13 is another early adopter. NNR13 has gracefully pointed out
several areas where mb2 could be (and has been) improved.  Furthermore,
NNR13 has consistently kept track of the health—physical
and mental—of the other players. It's always a delight to have
NNR13 present.</p>
<h3 id="dave-tall"><a class="header" href="#dave-tall">Dave Tall</a></h3>
<p>As I added a little bit of sound, here and there, to mb2, I poked
around and found various CC0 files to use. However, Dave Tall, a
fellow Albuquerquean played his trombone and recorded the game-change
fanfare and donated it to mb2.</p>

<p>Although mb2 is not currently stylized and most of the assets are
place-holders, I'm thankful that people create &quot;CC0&quot; works that are I
can add to mb2.</p>

<p>Although I'm currently the sole programmer working on mb2, I use
GitHub's issue tracker to log what I need to do and what I've done.
Although mb2 itself is closed-source, I have a public
<a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc">mb2-doc</a> GitHub repository and that's
where I track mb2 issues.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, Ed has chosen to watch that repository and every
once in a while he comments on an issue, typically in commiseration.
To a large extent I try to live my life as though someone were
watching me, in other words, I behave well even when nobody can see
that I'm doing so. However, knowing that Ed may be following my
commentary gives me a mental boost that I wouldn't have anticipated.</p>
