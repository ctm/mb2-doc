<p>Mb2 is poker software with a nice friendly player base.</p>
<p>Mb2 is in an early stage of development.  The server is world-class,
full-featured and state-of-the art.  However, the user interface is currently
mostly unstyled.</p>
<p>The server improves almost every day. The styling of the user interface has
slipped repeatedly, but has not been forgotten nor is it being ignored.</p>
<h3 id="read-no-further-try-the-demo"><a class="header" href="#read-no-further-try-the-demo">Read no further, Try the <a href="https://craftpoker.com">Demo</a></a></h3>
<p>Although ugly, the user interface is <em>mostly</em> self explanatory.  As
such, you can try the <a href="https://craftpoker.com">demo</a> and only come back to
this document if you're curious.</p>
<p>There's more information about the demo on the next page of this book.
To advance to the next page, scroll to the bottom of this page and
then click the <code>&gt;</code> in the lower right corner.</p>
<h3 id="come-back-for-a-tournament"><a class="header" href="#come-back-for-a-tournament">Come back for a tournament</a></h3>
<p>Although you can create your own tournaments and have them start
whenever you want, typically, the regulars start at least one tournament
per day.</p>
<p>The tournaments have <a href="fun_money.html">Fun Money</a> and bragging
rights as a prize.</p>
<p>The <a href="series/2024/wsop-style.html">WSOP-Style Series 2024</a> tournaments
start at 5:05 Pacific on weekdays and 3:03 PM Pacific on weekends.</p>
<h3 id="this-manual-is-player-driven"><a class="header" href="#this-manual-is-player-driven">This manual is… Player Driven</a></h3>
<p>Maintaining this documentation is currently, low-priority.</p>
<p>The regular players already know most of the information herein and
"outsiders" become insiders simply by joining and playing. However, if
there's anything you're curious about, ask in the lobby. Not only is
it likely that someone will answer, but your question and its answer
may well make it into this manual and help someone else.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="demo"><a class="header" href="#demo">Demo</a></h1>
<p>There's a button labeled <code>Demo</code> on
<a href="https://craftpoker.com" title="Pre-alpha">https://craftpoker.com</a></p>
<p>Go to the site, click that <code>Demo</code> button, and you'll be presented with
a modal dialog.</p>
<h3 id="default-values"><a class="header" href="#default-values">Default Values</a></h3>
<p>If you click the <code>CREATE</code> button without changing any of the values in
that dialog, you'll get a 2-player No-Limit Texas Hold'em tournament
whose structure is based on the 2022 World Series of Poker Main Event.</p>
<p>You'll then be logged into a demo <a href="./accounts.html">account</a> and be
placed in the <a href="./lobby.html">lobby</a>.  At the bottom of the lobby chat
will be instructions in red telling you to click the <code>Start</code> button to
start the tournament you just created.</p>
<p>When you click <code>Start</code>, your browser will attempt to open two pop-up
windows, one for each player.  If a pop-up blocker prevents the windows
from being opened, you'll told how to proceed.</p>
<h3 id="to-demo-something-other-than-2-player-texas-holdem"><a class="header" href="#to-demo-something-other-than-2-player-texas-holdem">To Demo Something other than 2 Player Texas Hold'em</a></h3>
<p>If you'd rather explore something else, you can see other
<a href="./games.html">games</a> by choosing a different
<a href="tournaments/structures.html">structure</a>.</p>
<h3 id="demo-limitations"><a class="header" href="#demo-limitations">Demo Limitations</a></h3>
<p>Demo accounts are able to chat with non-demo accounts, but are not
allowed to join events that require a buy-in (the events that don't
require buy-ins are demo events and testing events).</p>
<p>You are not able to change preferences of a demo account.</p>
<p>So, after you've played with the demo, you may want to create your own account.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="accounts"><a class="header" href="#accounts">Accounts</a></h1>
<p>Accounts are free.</p>
<p>You may create more than one, but please don't mislead.</p>
<p>Currently, no email account is associated with an account. Mb2's
purpose is to provide fun, not to sell you things or collect (much
less sell) your information. Mb2 currently doesn't even use cookies,
nor does it record your IP address.</p>
<h3 id="no-password-recovery-only-reset"><a class="header" href="#no-password-recovery-only-reset">No Password Recovery, Only Reset</a></h3>
<p>Your password is never stored in a database. Instead, a hash of a hash
of your password is stored (the first hash is done on the client side
so that your password is not sent to the server). Consequently there's
no way for anyone associated with mb2 to recover (or even observe)
your password.  Since mb2 doesn't use email addresses, the only way to
have your password reset is to ask (e.g., via chat or email).  So,
when you create an account, please remember or write down your
password.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="privacy"><a class="header" href="#privacy">Privacy</a></h1>
<p>At the time this page was written, every detail was correct.  However,
while mb2 is still under rapid deployment, there's a chance that some
of the information on this page may inadvertently become outdated.
So, don't bet your life—or anyone else's—that the
information here is correct.</p>
<p>Everyone's privacy is important to the developers of mb2. As such, mb2
does not use cookies.  Mb2 does, however, use your browser's session
storage and local storage to keep track of your being logged in and
connected to tables.  So, were your computer to be forensically
examined, it would be possible to tell that you've been connected to
mb2.</p>
<p>Mb2 logs almost all traffic between the client and the server.  The
exception is that your login credentials are not logged. These logs
are used for debugging and are currently retained forever.</p>
<p>Mb2 uses Cloudflare as a content delivery network, but the WebSockets
that connect your lobby and table pages to the server do not run
through Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Mb2 currently runs on AWS (Amazon Web Services). The initial
connection your browser makes to mb2 runs through an AWS Application
Load Balancer (ALB) which decrypts that initial HTTPS connection.
However, the successive connections your browser makes to mb2's server
run on WebSockets and the WebSocket connections do not go through an
ALB. These WebSockets are WSS encrypted and the traffic is decoded on
the AWS instance running mb2 (i.e., it is not decrypted at the Load
Balancer). Authentication credentials (e.g. your password's hash) are
only passed through the WebSockets.</p>
<h3 id="github-authentication"><a class="header" href="#github-authentication">GitHub Authentication</a></h3>
<p>As a proof-of-concept, mb2 allows players to create accounts using
GitHub's <a href="https://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> server.  Nobody is required or
even encouraged to use this obscure feature. It exists simply to make
sure that mb2's authorization subsystem supported OAuth. It is likely
that other OAuth servers will also be supported as options for
authorizing, but mb2 will never require an account to be created via
OAuth.  So, if you don't want Microsoft knowing you're using mb2,
don't use the GitHub Authentication.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="security"><a class="header" href="#security">Security</a></h1>
<p>Some of mb2's <a href="./privacy.html">privacy</a> features also provide a modicum
of security. Specifically, your password and all of your actions are
encrypted by your web browser and decrypted only inside mb2.
Similarly, your hole cards are encrypted by mb2 and only decrypted by
your browser.</p>
<p>Although mb2 logs your actions and your hole (or other down) cards,
those logs remain in mb2's memory until the hand is over. Only after
the hand has finished is that information logged to mb2's database.
Mb2 uses an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL Database instance that is encrypted
at rest.  Mb2 communicates with its database using SSL.</p>
<p>Your password is never stored.  Instead, a hash of your password is
stored.  That is sufficient for mb2 to be able to tell if you have
provided your password when you sign in. However, your password can
never be recovered, although it can be reset.</p>
<p>During development, mb2 uses
<a href="https://rust-random.github.io/book/guide-rngs.html?highlight=thread_rng#our-rngs"><code>thread_rng</code></a>
from the <a href="https://docs.rs/rand/0.8.3/rand/">rand crate</a> (crates are
essentially Rust libraries. Rust is the language mb2 is written
in). The authors of <code>thread_rng</code> believe it to be <a href="https://rust-random.github.io/book/guide-gen.html#cryptographically-secure-pseudo-random-number-generator">cryptographically
secure</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="new-to-poker"><a class="header" href="#new-to-poker">New to Poker?</a></h1>
<p>If you're new to poker, mb2 might be a little overwhelming. The
current mb2 player base is a group of people who already have quite a
lot of online poker experience.  Most of the current participants know
each other or want to help test the software or like the fact that mb2
deals a lot of esoteric games.</p>
<p>The current industry leader is PokerStars and they have a <a href="https://www.pokerstars.bet/poker/games/">nice
page</a> you can view without
registering.  An up and coming challenger to PokerStars is GGPoker and
they have a <a href="https://en.ggpoker.com/get-started/poker-school/">Poker
School</a> that
requires registration. PokerStars also has a
<a href="https://www.pokerstarsschool.com/">school</a>.</p>
<p>From mb2's developer's point of view, poker can—and
should—be fun, but poker can also be addicting. We're pro-fun
and anti-addiction (but non-judgmental). Nothing about mb2 is designed
to encourage you to play too much poker, much less get addicted.</p>
<p>If you play on mb2, great! Welcome aboard.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lobby"><a class="header" href="#lobby">Lobby</a></h1>
<p>After you sign in, you'll be in the lobby, where you can see the active
tables, a list of upcoming tournaments and recent chat.</p>
<p><img src="./lobby.png" alt="Lobby" title="Lobby" /></p>
<p>The <a href="./lobby/top_line.html">top line</a> in the lobby starts with the
nickname you've logged in as. After that are icons.</p>
<p>The second line lists the others logged in.</p>
<p>If any tables are active, each gets a row with the table id and a list
of the players at that table.  The table id itself is a link.  If you
click on it, you'll get a new window that allows you to observe that table.</p>
<p>The list of players at a table does not include former players or
observers. When a player busts, that player remains at the table as an
observer until that player leaves (i.e., closes the table window).</p>
<p>Any upcoming tournaments that you're allowed to join are listed below.
To join, click the check-box.  If you change your mind before
the tournament starts, click the check-box again and your buy-in will
be refunded and you won't be in the tournament when it starts.</p>
<p>When you join a tournament there may be esoteric options that you can
choose via a pull-down in the right most column.  They should be
self-explanatory.  Above that column is the little white plus sign
that brings up the tournament creation modal dialog (see below).</p>
<p>The column labeled <code>#</code> is the number of players currently signed up.  If
you want to see which players are signed up, bring your cursor over that
number and the entrants' nicknames will be revealed.</p>
<p>The starting time is in the timezone that your browser is configured
to display.  That's normally the timezone you're in, but check the
three letter timezone abbreviation to be sure.</p>
<p>A synopsis of the tournament structure is in the <code>Tournament</code> column.
If you bring your cursor over the synopsis, more details will drop
down.</p>
<p>The rest of the lobby is chat and a box for you to type your own chat.
All chat is logged, but only the chat from the last twenty-four hours
is displayed when you log in.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="top-line"><a class="header" href="#top-line">Top Line</a></h1>
<h3 id="your-nickname"><a class="header" href="#your-nickname">Your Nickname</a></h3>
<p>At the top of the lobby is your nickname (e.g., <code>☕ deadhead</code>). That can be useful if you want to see how you've
customized your nickname (e.g., with capitalization, punctuation,
white-space or emojis).</p>
<h2 id="players-manual"><a class="header" href="#players-manual">Players Manual</a></h2>
<p>Immediately to the right is circled-i icon.  If you click that icon,
this Players' Manual is opened in a new tab or window.</p>
<h2 id="reports"><a class="header" href="#reports">Reports</a></h2>
<p>The next icon looks like three horizontal lines, each with a dot
in front of them.  This is the reports drop-down icon. It's where
you can choose to see various leaderboards or the recent tournaments.</p>
<h3 id="leaderboards"><a class="header" href="#leaderboards">Leaderboards</a></h3>
<p>By default, the net profit leaderboards only show
players who have won more Fun Money in payouts than they've paid in
buy-ins. However, if you have a non-positive balance and you want to
see it, you can hold down the shift key when you click one of the
leaderboard menu items.  If you hold the shift key down when you click
and you don't see your nick, then no tournaments have finished that
you were entered in.</p>
<h3 id="recent-tournaments"><a class="header" href="#recent-tournaments">Recent Tournaments</a></h3>
<p>Recent Tournaments brings up a list of the non-demo/non-test
tournaments that have finished in the last month.</p>
<p>Each row contains the starting date and time of the tournament, the
Fun Money buy-in, the number of entrants and the name of the Event.
If you click on a row, the results from that tournament are displayed.</p>
<h4 id="bragging-or-crying-rights"><a class="header" href="#bragging-or-crying-rights">Bragging (or crying) Rights</a></h4>
<p>When you bring up the results of a specific tournament, there is a
little icon to the right of the name of that tournament. It looks like
a couple of (three if you count the sideways one) links in a chain. If
you click on that icon, the URL for this result will be copied to the
pasteboard which can then be pasted into email, twitter or some other
messaging system.</p>
<p>Here's an example: <a href="https://craftpoker.com/event/3083/player/10">https://craftpoker.com/event/3083/player/10</a></p>
<h2 id="rules"><a class="header" href="#rules">Rules</a></h2>
<p>Beyond that is a drop-down menu to the rules for almost all the games
Mb2 knows how to deal.  Action Razzdugi does not currently have an
entry, but it's just like Razzdugi, except the Razz half is Action
Razz.</p>
<h2 id="audio"><a class="header" href="#audio">Audio</a></h2>
<p>The next item is a bell, which allows you to mute the gong. The gong
is rung when a new tournament is added.  That alerts people to the
presence of the new tournament so they can sign up. If your bell is
green, the gong will be played. If gray, it won't.  If you hover
your mouse over the bell, it will tell you its status.</p>
<p>Some daily tournaments have the tradition of encouraging the winner to
pick the following day's tournament. It's viscerally satisfying to
win, create the successor tournament and then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4o4Q9sd_y4">bang a
gong</a>.</p>
<h2 id="preferences"><a class="header" href="#preferences">Preferences</a></h2>
<p>If you are logged in to a non-demo account, your final icon will be
what looks like three horizontal sliders. Clicking it allows you to
set <a href="lobby/./preferences.html">preferences</a> that are remembered
indefinitely.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="creating-tournaments"><a class="header" href="#creating-tournaments">Creating Tournaments</a></h1>
<p>In the <a href="lobby/../lobby.html">lobby</a>, if you click on the white plus small icon, you get
a dialog that looks something like:</p>
<p><img src="lobby/./create-tournament.png" alt="Create Tournament" title="Create Tournament" /></p>
<h3 id="type"><a class="header" href="#type">Type</a></h3>
<p>For now, just leave the Type as <code>Tournament</code>.</p>
<h3 id="structure"><a class="header" href="#structure">Structure</a></h3>
<p>The Structure attribute is a pull-down menu from one of more than a
hundred pre-existing tournament structures.  Currently you can not
create your own structure.</p>
<h3 id="buy-in"><a class="header" href="#buy-in">Buy-in</a></h3>
<p>Tournaments that are created for testing or demo purposes should be
Free, since free tournaments don't affect anyone's standings.
Tournaments where people are expected to play well should
have a 100 buy-in if for no other reason than to make it clear that
the participants will be taking the tournament seriously.</p>
<h3 id="bounty"><a class="header" href="#bounty">Bounty</a></h3>
<p>If the <code>25</code> radio button is selected, then sufficient Fun Money is
deducted from the prize pool so that an award of FM 25 can be made to
the player who busts another player.  If N people are in a tournament,
then N-1 bounties will be paid out by the time the tournament ends.</p>
<h3 id="comment"><a class="header" href="#comment">Comment</a></h3>
<p>Adding a comment is optional.  If you add a comment, it will show up
when people hover over the tournament structure in the listing of
upcoming tournaments.</p>
<h3 id="autostart"><a class="header" href="#autostart">Autostart</a></h3>
<p>If you put a number in the <code>Autostart</code> field, then the tournament will
start automatically once that number of participants join. In general,
you should not create an autostart tournament unless you think there
are enough people in the lobby to sign up within five or ten minutes,
otherwise you may find that nobody will sign up because it will be too
hard to predict when it will start.</p>
<p>If you put a number in <code>Autostart</code>, the <code>Start At</code> field will be removed.
You can only either start by <code>Autostart</code> or <code>Start At</code>, not both.</p>
<h3 id="start-at"><a class="header" href="#start-at">Start At</a></h3>
<p>Start At is in the same timezone as upcoming tournaments are displayed in.
That's whatever your browser thinks your timezone is.  The first time
you bring up the "Add a Tournament" dialog, "Start At" is pre-populated
with a value that is ten minutes into the future.  However, after that,
the dialog simply remembers whatever value was in that field previously.</p>
<p>If the lobby observes that you've won a tournament, then the next time
you create a tournament, Start At will be pre-populated with the same
starting time as the tournament you won, but be on the following
day. This helps people who win the evening or night tournaments,
because the convention is to let the winner choose the tournament for
the following day.</p>
<h3 id="round-duration"><a class="header" href="#round-duration">Round Duration</a></h3>
<p>Round Duration (Minutes) is in essence a scaling factor.  In most
tournaments, all rounds are the same length.  When create a new tournament
and specify the round duration, what you're <em>really</em> doing is saying how
long you want the first round to be.  If any rounds have a different duration
from the duration of the first round, they'll be scaled.</p>
<p>So, if there's a structure where the odd numbered rounds are 20 minutes
and the even numbered rounds are 30 minutes, if you specify Round
Duration as 5 minutes, then you'll have a tournament where the odd
numbered rounds are 5 minutes and the even ones are 7.5 minutes.</p>
<p>The TOC (Tournament of Champions) style format has a 15 minute Hold'em
first round, an 18 minute Stud second round and a 22 minute Omaha/8
third round.  So, if "Round Duration (Minutes)" is set to 5, then the
second round will be 6 minutes and the third round will be seven
minutes, twenty seconds long.</p>
<p>For a dozen or so players, five minute rounds for most structures results
in a tournament that finishes in about an hour and a half.</p>
<h3 id="seconds-to-act"><a class="header" href="#seconds-to-act">Seconds to Act</a></h3>
<p>Seconds to Act is how much time a player gets to act before being sent
to vacation.  No, 999 is not a reasonable number of "Seconds to Act".
Typically we use 45 there and that's the default when this dialog comes
up.</p>
<p>A player may call time to get more time to act.  There currently is no
limit on how many times a player can call time.  Calling time resets
the number of seconds to act (it does <em>not</em> add to the number of
seconds to act).  So, if "Seconds to Act after calling Time" is set to
60, calling time will mean that the player must act within 60 seconds
regardless of how much time to act the player had remaining.</p>
<h3 id="synchronized-breaks"><a class="header" href="#synchronized-breaks">Synchronized Breaks</a></h3>
<p>Schedules have breaks built into them, and like Round Duration, they
scale based on the same ration of the "Round Duration (Minutes)"
setting to the duration of the first level in the structure.  That can
result in breaks that would be too short were it not for the "Minimum
Break Duration in Minutes" setting.  However, the duration of a break
is like the duration of a round in that it can start in the middle of
a hand. The players who are still in the hand still need to finish the
hand.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="preferences-1"><a class="header" href="#preferences-1">Preferences</a></h1>
<p>If you click on the <a href="lobby/./top_line.html#preferences">preferences icon</a> in
the top line of the lobby, you'll get a modal dialog that looks
something like the following.</p>
<p>Almost all of these preferences control what will happen on subsequent
table windows created for you. The <code>New Tournament</code> check-box in the
<code>Sounds To Play</code> section is the exception. The New Tournament sound
comes from the lobby.</p>
<p>The slightly confusing options are: <code>Four Color When Badugi</code> <code>Deck Color</code> option and the <code>Only When Auto-Seated</code> <code>Auto-Center</code> option.</p>
<h3 id="four-color-when-badugi"><a class="header" href="#four-color-when-badugi">Four Color When Badugi</a></h3>
<p><code>Four Color When Badugi</code> is a setting "between" <code>Black and Red</code> and
<code>Four Color</code>.</p>
<p><code>Black and Red</code> always uses <strong>black</strong> for clubs and spades
and <span style="color:red">red</span> for diamonds and hearts.</p>
<p><code>Four Color</code> always uses <span style="color:green">green</span> for
clubs, <span style="color:blue">blue</span> for diamonds, <span style="color:red">red</span> for hearts and <strong>black</strong> for spades.</p>
<p><code>Four Color When Badugi</code> uses <code>Black and Red</code> unless the game currently
being played uses Badugi ranking when figuring out how to award or
split the pot, in which case <code>Four Color</code> is used. So whether or not
to use a four color deck can change each time the game changes.</p>
<h3 id="auto-seated"><a class="header" href="#auto-seated">Auto-Seated</a></h3>
<p>When you play a tournament, you do not get to choose your seat, hence
you are auto-seated.</p>
<p>When Ring Game support is added, you'll have the option of choosing
your seat when a seat is available or having a seat assigned to you
when coming off a wait list.</p>
<p>So, for now, there's basically no difference between <code>Always</code> and
<code>Only When Auto-Seated</code>.</p>
<p><img src="lobby/./preferences.png" alt="Preferences" title="Preferences Modal Dialog" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tables"><a class="header" href="#tables">Tables</a></h1>
<p>Mb2 creates a new pop-up window for each table you are seated at or you
are observing. A table looks something like this<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<p><img src="./table.png" alt="Table" title="Table" /></p>
<p>Most of the elements in a table window should be self-explanatory.
Additionally, most also have a "tooltip" associated with them.  The
tooltip will be revealed if you leave your mouse over an element
that contains a tooltip.</p>
<p>The remaining pages of this Tables chapter document or clarify some of
the things that may not be self-explanatory.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Currently, there are also two textual representations of a table,
but this manual ignores them because they are likely to go away after
the graphical interface becomes more attractive to the current text view
players.</p>
</div>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="top-line-1"><a class="header" href="#top-line-1">Top Line</a></h1>
<p>The upper left portion of a table consists of a row of icons that can be
clicked on. Most of them make temporary changes to the appearance of
your table. They all have associated tooltips that tell you what they'll
do if you click them.</p>
<h3 id="players-manual-1"><a class="header" href="#players-manual-1">Players Manual</a></h3>
<p>Like in the lobby, the left-most icon is a circled i.  If you click
that icon, this Players' Manual is opened in a new tab or window.</p>
<h3 id="table-view"><a class="header" href="#table-view">Table View</a></h3>
<p>The next icon switches between</p>
<ul>
<li>diagonal arrows pointing outward (at the top of the window)</li>
<li>diagonal arrows pointing inward (at the bottom of the window)</li>
<li>a landscape picture of mountains (at the bottom of the window)</li>
</ul>
<p>This icon is telling you what Will happen if you click it. If you're in the Table
view, you'll switch to the Text view.  If you're in the Text view and you
click it, you'll switch into the Compact Text view.</p>
<p>The text views are unsupported and undocumented. If you prefer to use
them, please let Cliff (aka deadhead) know what causes your preference
so that he can improve the graphical view to the point that you'll
prefer that to the text view.</p>
<h3 id="rotation"><a class="header" href="#rotation">Rotation</a></h3>
<p>If you click the curved arrow, the table will be rotated clockwise,
unless you have the shift key held down when you click it. If you have
the shift key held down and you click the curved arrow, the table will
rotate counter-clockwise.</p>
<h3 id="audio-1"><a class="header" href="#audio-1">Audio</a></h3>
<p>You can click on the bell icon to adjust whether or not certain sounds
are played at this table. You have more control of which sounds are
played in the <a href="tables/../lobby/preferences.html">Preferences dialog</a>
available from the Lobby.</p>
<h3 id="game-notification"><a class="header" href="#game-notification">Game Notification</a></h3>
<p>The circled exclamation point is similar to the bell, but it changes
which game and/or level notifications you get.</p>
<h3 id="deck-color"><a class="header" href="#deck-color">Deck Color</a></h3>
<p>The paint bucket allows you to change whether to use a normal two-color
(diamonds and hearts are red, clubs and spades are black) deck or a
four-color deck (clubs are green, diamonds are blue, hearts are red and
spades are black).</p>
<p>If you hold the shift key down when you click on the paint bucket, you
change the color of the back of the cards.</p>
<h3 id="messages-to-display"><a class="header" href="#messages-to-display">Messages to Display</a></h3>
<p>Clicking on the "quotation box" icon allows you to adjust what messages show
up in your chat-box (or chat-window if you Pop-out your chat).</p>
<h3 id="number-of-observers"><a class="header" href="#number-of-observers">Number of Observers</a></h3>
<p>Clicking on the star icon allows you to see how many people are
watching your table and how many non-players are watching you in
specific. People who are logged in can watch your table by clicking on
the table number in the lobby.  When you're playing, <a href="tables/./shareable-urls.html">your URL is
shareable</a>. If you share your URL and someone
follows that link, that person is watching <em>you</em> play, meaning if you
get sent to another table, they will automatically be switched to
watching that table, too.</p>
<p>After you click on the star, you get something that looks like <code>T: 0, P: 0</code> where the number after the <code>T:</code> is the number of people watching
your table and the number after the <code>P:</code> is the number of people
watching you, the player.</p>
<p>Observers are only counted while they have a table window open.  So if
you share your URL with ten people and three of them start watching at
the same time, you'll get <code>P: 3</code>, which will increase if anyone else
follows that link before any of the original three close their window.</p>
<p>Although it hasn't been properly load-tested yet, mb2 is designed to
support tens of thousands and eventually hundreds of players and/or
observers efficiently.  During pre-alpha testing it is unlikely that
we'll overload the server, although it could happen if someone with a
huge social network shares a URL.  If that happens, I'll make
load-testing and bandwidth limiting an exceedingly high priority.
Otherwise, I'll try to get it done before it's needed.</p>
<h3 id="optional-scroll-to-the-bottom"><a class="header" href="#optional-scroll-to-the-bottom"><em>Optional</em> Scroll to the Bottom</a></h3>
<p>When there are too many lines to display in the chat-box or
chat-window, a scroll-bar is presented. If you scroll backward, a
down-arrow appears.  The down-arrow is black when it's not your turn
to act and red when it is.  If you click on the down-arrow it
immediately scrolls forward so that the bottom (most recent) message
is visible.</p>
<h3 id="optional-hands-remaining"><a class="header" href="#optional-hands-remaining"><em>Optional</em> Hands Remaining</a></h3>
<p>Which games are played in a tournament are determined by the
tournament's <a href="tables/../tournaments/structures.html">structure</a>.</p>
<p>Some
tournament structures only have a single game in them (e.g. a No-Limit
Hold'em tournament). Others are mixes, like <strong>HORSE</strong> (<strong>H</strong>old'em,
<strong>O</strong>maha, <strong>R</strong>azz, <strong>S</strong>tud, Stud/<strong>E</strong>ight).</p>
<p>However, tournament structures have two different ways to determine when
to change game</p>
<ul>
<li>by a count (<strong>HORSE</strong> is by count)</li>
<li>by level (TOC-style is by level)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are playing on a table where the game is going to change via a
count, the last button on the top-line can tell you how many times
more the current game will be played after the current hand completes.
If you don't want to see that that information (perhaps you're teaching
yourself how to count to six), you can click it and the button will
remain, but the number won't be shown.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="advanced-checkboxes"><a class="header" href="#advanced-checkboxes">Advanced Checkboxes</a></h1>
<p>In general, checkboxes are used to select choices before it's your turn to
act.  If you have bad cards and you know you're going to fold when it
is your turn, you can click on a <code>Fold</code> checkbox. If you change your mind
before it becomes your turn you can simply uncheck the checkbox.</p>
<p>Many of the checkboxes act like "radio buttons" do in other interfaces. If
you check <code>Fold</code> and then check <code>Call Any</code>, the <code>Fold</code> checkbox will
automatically be unchecked.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="immediate-buttons"><a class="header" href="#immediate-buttons">Immediate Buttons</a></h1>
<p>When it is your turn to act, if you have not previously specified a valid
advanced action, you'll be presented with buttons that represent what you
can do. Unlike checkboxes, you can't change your mind once you click a
button.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="shareable-urls"><a class="header" href="#shareable-urls">Shareable URLs</a></h1>
<p>When you are at a table, the URL in the location portion of your
table's windowframe is a URL that you can share with people.  People
who visit the URL can watch the game (if there's still something to
watch).</p>
<p>For example, the URL
<a href="https://craftpoker.com/event/3076/player/10">https://craftpoker.com/event/3076/player/10</a>
was from a tournament on February 22nd, 2022. Specifically, that was
deadhead's (player #10) URL. The tournament started at 5:05 Pacific
and deadhead bust at 6:15 Pacific, so if anyone had visited that URL
between when the tournament started and when deadhead bust, that
person would have seen the game playing in real time.</p>
<p>If a URL includes a player, then it is player-specific and the
observer will automatically follow the player if the player is
assigned to a different table.</p>
<p>If a URL is visited after the player has bust or won, a summary of the
event will be displayed. E.g.,</p>
<p><img src="tables/./deadhead-fsatg.png" alt="Deadhead Bust" title="Deadhead is not good at this game" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="review-button"><a class="header" href="#review-button">Review Button</a></h1>
<p>Clicking the review button brings up a pane in the lower left corner of the
table window. That pane shows the ending of the previous hand: players' hole
cards (unless they mucked) and the hand they made.</p>
<p>The winning "high"<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> hands are in green (and bold, so color-blind
people can recognize them).  The winning "low" hands are in blue (and
italics). If you mouse over a high or low label that has won chips from
a pot, the amount won is displayed as a "tooltip". If there are multiple
pots (due to one or more players being all-in), the amounts won from each
pot are shown.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Some games split the pot with two different high hands, e.g., Dramaha,
where one high hand is made using the board and the other high hand is made
using solely the player's hole cards. In games like these, one of the two
high hands gets the extra chip if there is one. It's the high hand that
gets the extra chip that will be in green and bold.</p>
</div>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="fun-money"><a class="header" href="#fun-money">Fun Money</a></h1>
<p>Mb2 "keeps score" by tracking "Fun Money", an abstraction of what a
real life poker player spends and perhaps wins while playing poker.</p>
<h2 id="no-intrinsic-value"><a class="header" href="#no-intrinsic-value">No Intrinsic Value</a></h2>
<p>Mb2 keeps track of how much Fun Money you spend and win.  It's a point
system that helps keep the playing of virtual poker fun and challenging.
Although it has no intrinsic worth, players are encouraged to take it
semi-seriously, because, for mb2's intended player-base, playing with
people who are all taking it semi-seriously is more fun!</p>
<h2 id="you-start-with-zero-but"><a class="header" href="#you-start-with-zero-but">You start with Zero, but…</a></h2>
<p>When you create an mb2 account, you start with no Fun Money. However, most
events allow you to participate by running a deficit. You can lessen your
deficit and run a surplus by winning.</p>
<h3 id="buy-ins"><a class="header" href="#buy-ins">Buy-ins</a></h3>
<p>The only thing you can spend Fun Money on is buying into events, i.e. <a href="./tournaments.html">Tournaments</a> or <a href="./ring_games.html">Ring Games</a>.</p>
<h3 id="pay-outs"><a class="header" href="#pay-outs">Pay-outs</a></h3>
<p>The four ways you can gain Fun Money are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finishing high in a tournament</li>
<li>Busting a player in a bounty tournament</li>
<li>Being one of the top three ticket winners in a derby tournament</li>
<li>Leaving a Ring Game with more chips than you entered with</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tournaments"><a class="header" href="#tournaments">Tournaments</a></h1>
<p>Mb2 is currently tournament-centric.  This is mostly a side-effect of
tournaments being more complicated than <a href="./ring_games.html">ring games</a>.
Sometimes when creating a new architecture for a software project, it
makes sense to implement the more complicated parts first, especially
if the less complicated parts are in some sense a subset of more
complicated ones.</p>
<h2 id="joining-and-unjoining"><a class="header" href="#joining-and-unjoining">Joining and Unjoining</a></h2>
<p>The tournaments that you're allowed to join show up in the lobby.
Each has a checkbox to the left. If you mark the checkbox before that
tournament starts, then when it starts, you'll be included. If you
change your mind, just uncheck the box.</p>
<h3 id="late-registration"><a class="header" href="#late-registration">Late Registration</a></h3>
<p>After a tournament has started, if the tournament supports late registration,
you can click the check-box and join that tournament in progress.  If
there is a seat open, you'll be seated immediately.  If not, a new table
may need to be created and that will only be done when there are enough
movable players (players not in a hand) on the existing tables to move
enough to create a new table, but keep things balanced.</p>
<h3 id="re-entry"><a class="header" href="#re-entry">Re-entry</a></h3>
<p>Some tournaments allow re-entry. To re-enter a tournament, you click the
same check-box you used to enter. However, not all tournaments allow any
re-entry and those that do often limit each player to one or two re-entries.
Additionally, the re-entry window typically closes at the end of a level
(e.g., "Level 9") and the re-entry automatically closes as soon as the
number of players left meets the minimum number of places pay (i.e., each
remaining player is guaranteed to win some <a href="fun_money.html">Fun Money</a>).</p>
<h2 id="creating"><a class="header" href="#creating">Creating</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="./lobby/new_event.html">Tournament Creation</a> page is in the Lobby
sub-section of this manual, because you create a new tournament by
clicking on a circled plus sign that's in the lobby.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="structures"><a class="header" href="#structures">Structures</a></h1>
<p>How a tournament is played is defined by the tournament's structure. Structures
contain information like</p>
<ul>
<li>how many chips a player starts with</li>
<li>how many <a href="tournaments/../esoterica/lammers.html">lammers</a>, if any, a player starts with</li>
<li>the levels</li>
<li>the breaks</li>
<li>how many seats per table</li>
</ul>
<p>Each level includes information like</p>
<ul>
<li>which game(s) are played at that level</li>
<li>the stakes for the games</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limitations"><a class="header" href="#limitations">Limitations</a></h3>
<p>Some of the information for a structure is available from the list of
tournaments available in the lobby. Some of the other information is
hidden, solely because nobody has written a nice UI to reveal that
information.</p>
<p>You can not currently define your own structures, but mb2 has well over
a hundred structures "baked in."</p>
<h3 id="examples"><a class="header" href="#examples">Examples</a></h3>
<p>You can see example structure sheets in the <a href="tournaments/../barge/structures.html">*ARGE Structures</a> section of
this manual.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="templates"><a class="header" href="#templates">Templates</a></h1>
<p>Each tournament is governed by a structure, like you would see on a
structure sheet.  The information in a structure is a combination of
information that is stored in a structure template and parameters that
are customized, typically by choosing values in the creation dialog.</p>
<p>Mb2 does not yet have the ability to create structure sheets, but the
first step toward doing that is to provide a human readable version of
structure templates.  The beginning of that functionality was introduced
at the end of April, 2024.</p>
<h2 id="differences-between-structure-templates-and-sheets"><a class="header" href="#differences-between-structure-templates-and-sheets">Differences between Structure Templates and Sheets</a></h2>
<h3 id="customizable-parameters"><a class="header" href="#customizable-parameters">Customizable Parameters</a></h3>
<p>Several structure sheet items do not come from the template. So,
although they will be on structure sheets—when structure sheets
are implemented—they are not on structure templates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy-in</li>
<li>Bounties</li>
<li>Comment</li>
<li>Starting Criteria</li>
<li>Seconds to Act</li>
<li>Calling Time Criteria</li>
<li>Synchronized Breaks (i.e., whether to use)</li>
<li>Late Registration</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your patience and understanding.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="payouts"><a class="header" href="#payouts">Payouts</a></h1>
<p>Currently all tournaments with a buy-in pay out via the <a href="tournaments/../barge/payouts.html">BARGE Unified
Payout Schedule</a>.  The size of the payout pool
is the sum of all of the buy-ins minus any amount reserved for bounties.
Currently, in rebuy and/or add-on tournaments, none of the rebuy or add-on
buy-in goes into the prize pool.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="series"><a class="header" href="#series">Series</a></h1>
<p>A group of tournaments can be bound into a series by an
administrator. There is currently no administrative user-interface, so
series are relatively rare.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="historical"><a class="header" href="#historical">Historical</a></h1>
<p>The first four were put together and run in 2020 and early 2021 as
substitutes for the normally-in-a-casino BARGE, FARGO, ATLARGE and
EMBARGO events. Each of those four series were private. In order to
even see the tournaments in the lobby, a player needed to be
authorized.</p>
<p>Although not nearly as much fun as meeting in person, the substitute
series were fun and well-received. However, they're in the past and
there's not much point to documenting them in this book, except this
little exchange on the ATLARGE mailing list in March 2023:</p>
<p>Goldie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm in an embarrassing situation and I need your help, please.</p>
<p>ATLARGE2020 did not happen in Atlantic City due to the pandemic raging at that time (April 2020).  Instead, we held an on-line ATLARGE2020 later in the year, on Deadhead's poker site.</p>
<p>Long story, but I've been doing a lot of packing and unpacking lately, and just came across the winner's trophy for the ATLARGE2020 NLHE event.  So here's my problem:  I can't remember who won! If anyone can remember who won this event, or better yet if the winner will contact me, I will arrange to get your trophy to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2022, Craft Poker Co. held two series of tournaments, WSOPS, where
the winner of each tournament was sent an engraved prize and WYwAB
where there were no physical prizes.  Unsurprisingly, WSOPS was better
attended.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="wsop-style-2022"><a class="header" href="#wsop-style-2022">WSOP-Style 2022</a></h1>
<h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The WSOP-Style 2022 Series consisted of a tournament a day from
Saturday, June 11th through Sunday, July 3rd, 2022.  Each tournament started
at 3pm Pacific time (6pm Eastern).</p>
<p>There was <a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues/183">no late
entry</a>. Additionally,
instead of re-entries, the tournaments used rebuys.  The difference
being that rebuys happen immediately after you bust and you retain the
seat that you were busted in.  So, when the structure sheet said the
tournament supported two re-entries through level 15, you were
allowed (but not required) to rebuy up to twice, but only through
level 15.</p>
<p>This series was open to the public.</p>
<h2 id="prize-for-first-place"><a class="header" href="#prize-for-first-place">Prize for first place</a></h2>
<p>Craft Poker Co. sent a physical prize to the winner of each
tournament in the series<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. The prize will be an <a href="https://www.trophies2go.com/engraved-rettangolo-glass-paperweight.html">Engraved Rectangular
Glass
Paperweight</a>
unless they run out or other unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>There will <em>probably</em> also be nicer prizes for the top three
leaderboard at the end of the series, but nothing has been finalized yet.</p>
<h2 id="leaderboard"><a class="header" href="#leaderboard">Leaderboard</a></h2>
<p>Mb2 knows which tournaments belonged to this series and there is a
"WSOPS Leaderboard" available from the lobby.</p>
<p>The leaderboard tracked <a href="series/2022/../../fun_money.html">Fun Money</a>.  Each of the tournaments
had an FM 200 buy-in and Fun Money is awarded using the <a href="series/2022/../../barge/payouts.html">BARGE Unified Payout

the Fun Money from rebuys goes directly into the prize pool,</p>

<li>Saturday and Sunday: 3pm Pacific time (6pm Eastern)</li>
</ul>
<p>All but six of the tournaments finished in under two and a half hours.
The Razz Championship lasted three hours, eleven minutes.</p>
<p>Four of the fifty tournaments had trouble and were rescheduled as
documented in the footnotes of the table below.</p>
<h2 id="prize-for-first-place-1"><a class="header" href="#prize-for-first-place-1">Prize for first place</a></h2>

<p>There were also larger cash awards for the top three players on the

Those awards were $250, $125 and $85 for first, second and third.</p>
<p>To qualify for an overall win rate prize, the player must had to have

<p>All events in this series were open to the public, although they weren't
well publicized.</p>
<h3 id="no-late-registration"><a class="header" href="#no-late-registration">No Late Registration</a></h3>
<p>During the series, late registration was not yet available (it is
now).  Because there was no late registration, the tournaments didn't
actually start until five minutes after the hour, but they started
<strong>exactly</strong> at five minutes after the hour.</p>
<h3 id="rebuys-instead-of-re-entries"><a class="header" href="#rebuys-instead-of-re-entries">Rebuys instead of re-entries</a></h3>
<p>Another major difference is that instead of re-entries, the
tournaments used rebuys.  When rebuys were available to you, there was
a checkbox that you could have checked to request a rebuy when you bust.  If
that checkbox was checked, a rebuy happened immediately after you bust
and you retained the seat that you were busted in.  If that check box
wasn't checked <strong>before</strong> you bust, you were not able to rebuy or
re-enter.</p>
<p>So, when the structure sheet said the tournament supports two
re-entries through level 15, you were allowed (but not required) to
rebuy up to twice, but only through level 15.</p>
<h2 id="leaderboard-1"><a class="header" href="#leaderboard-1">Leaderboard</a></h2>
<p>Mb2 knows which tournaments belong to this series and there is a
"WSOPS 2023 LEADERBOARD" menu entry reachable from the top-line in the
lobby. It's in the middle of the reports drop-down, which is the first
small icon to the right of the circled-i.  The reports drop-down icon
itself consists of three horizontal lines, each with a dot before it.</p>
<p>The leaderboard tracks <a href="series/2023/../../fun_money.html">Fun Money</a>.  Each of the tournaments
had an FM 200 buy-in and Fun Money is awarded using the <a href="series/2023/../../barge/payouts.html">BARGE Unified Payout
Schedule</a>. All rebuys are for FM 200 each and all of
the Fun Money from rebuys goes directly into the prize pool,</p>
<h3 id="round-duration-1"><a class="header" href="#round-duration-1">Round Duration</a></h3>
<p>The initial rounds of each daily tournament was five minutes long.</p>
<p>If the structure sheet for a tournament had longer rounds on
successive days, the levels that correspond to those days were
longer in the same proportion.</p>
<p>For example, Event #22, the Limit Hold'em Championship's <a href="https://www.wsop.com/pdfs/structuresheets/structure_5219_21687.pdf">structure
sheet</a>
listed Levels 1-6 as 40 minutes, 7-10 as 60 minutes and 11-end as 90
minutes.  When played here, the first six levels were five minutes
long, since those are the initial levels. Levels seven through ten
were seven and a half minutes long (60 / 40 * 5). The remaining
levels were eleven and a quarter minutes long (90 / 40 * 5).</p>
<p>If you click on a nickname in the winner column, you can see how long
that tournament took.</p>
<h2 id="the-tournaments-1"><a class="header" href="#the-tournaments-1">The Tournaments</a></h2>
<p>The
individual tournaments were available for registration in the
<a href="https://ctm.github.io/docs/players_manual/lobby.html">lobby</a> for
several days (typically at least a week) before the start of each
tournament.</p>
<p>Tournament winners were typically be updated within a day
of the completion of each tournament, although there were
delays around <a href="https://www.wser.org/">June 24th</a>.</p>

<a href="https://www.barge.org/barge-2023-schedule">BARGE</a>".</p>
<p>WYWAB is an
annual series of mb2 tournaments that uses the same tournament
structures (and typically same starting times) as most of the
tournaments that are spread at BARGE.</p>
<p>WYWAB tournaments are open to all and they're free.</p>
<p>In 2023, the winner of each tournament received $50 via Venmo or Zelle.</p>
<h2 id="the-tournaments-2"><a class="header" href="#the-tournaments-2">The Tournaments</a></h2>
<p>In 2023, all eight tournaments were held in July.
The times listed in this table are all in Pacific Daylight, since that's what
was on the structure sheets due to it being the time zone of Las Vegas.
However, in the mb2, all times are in the time zone the browser

<h2 id="some-differences"><a class="header" href="#some-differences">Some Differences</a></h2>
<p>Mb2, the software used to run the tournaments is very flexible, but
WYWAB 2023 was put together quickly. As such, two of the
complex-to-implement structures were not dealt (NLHE Crapshoot
tournament and 3 Hand Hold'em).</p>
<p>For the tournaments that were dealt, some differences were just to
improve the online experience and keep the tournaments from taking too
long:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Except for the Tournament of Champions style tournament, rounds
lasted ten minutes.  The Tournament of Champions style tournament
had seven and a half minute Hold'em rounds, nine minute Stud rounds
and eleven minute Omaha/8 rounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There were no chip races.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breaks started "on the 55", which means that once each table has finished
a hand after fifty-five minutes after the hour, all tables will get a five
minute break.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These differences, however, were due to a lack of time:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In each tournament with a big blind ante, the antes were posted
<em>before</em> the big blind.  That meant that if you only had a fraction of
the big blind after paying the ante, you were only able to win the
ante plus the amount of chips you got when you multiplied that
fraction of the big blind by the number of players who had also put in
that much or more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Final tables of mixed game tournaments did not restart the mix at the
beginning. So, for example, although the Limit 6 Game HORSE tournament
started with Hold'em, the final table continued dealing whatever it was
dealing before the other table that was merged into it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "No Limit Hold'em <del>Go the Distance</del> Bounty" tournament was
played until there was only one player left. That player,
<a href="https://craftpoker.com/event/4659/player/37">ts4z</a>, won the $50.</p>

<p>With the exception of the May 28th and July 5th events, there were
no prizes.  The May 28th tournament had six players, so two places paid:
jrx won $100 for finishing first and smalltalkdan won $45 for coming in
second.  The July 5th event had sixteen players<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, so four places paid:
smalltalkdan won $100, tegwin won $65 in second place, jpmassar $45 in
third and JADC🚴 received $35 for fourth.</p>
<h2 id="overview-6"><a class="header" href="#overview-6">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The WSOP-Style Series is a set of free tournaments
one per day, from May 28th through July 17th. Those are the days
the World Series of Poker are being held in Las Vegas, Nevada and the World
Series of Poker prov6ides the inspiration for this series.</p>
<p><strong>This series is not even remotely affiliated with the World Series of Poker.</strong></p>
<p>This series does, however, use modified versions of the World Series
of Poker tournament structures for each of the daily tournaments, with
the exception of July 5th (<a href="series/2024/wsop-style.html#july-5th">see below</a>).  All of the craftpoker.com
WSOP-Style tournaments are played in one day, with five minute breaks
every hour. Each starts at 5:05 pm Pacific time (8:05 pm Eastern).</p>
<p>Late registration varies per tournament, but is always available for at least
thirty-five minutes after the tournament starts.</p>
<p>Many tournaments allow one or more re-entries.</p>
<h3 id="all-are-welcome"><a class="header" href="#all-are-welcome">All are welcome</a></h3>
<p>All events in this series are open to the public.</p>
<h3 id="no-early-start-on-weekend"><a class="header" href="#no-early-start-on-weekend">No Early Start on Weekend</a></h3>
<p>Unlike 2022 and 2023, when the weekend tournaments started two hours
earlier than the weekday tournaments, all WSOP-Style Series
tournaments <strong>in 2024</strong> start at the same time (5:05 pm Pacific).</p>
<h3 id="round-duration-3"><a class="header" href="#round-duration-3">Round Duration</a></h3>
<p>All levels will be five minutes long.</p>
<p>There will be a five minute break that will start after each table has
completed a hand at 55 minutes past the hour or later. That means the
last table to finish a hand at 55 minutes past the hour or later will
get exactly a five minute breaks and all other tables will be paused
while waiting for that table to finish a hand.</p>
<h3 id="leaderboard-2"><a class="header" href="#leaderboard-2">Leaderboard</a></h3>
<p>There is a "WSOPS 2024 Leaderboard" entry in the Leaderboard menu
available in the lobby.  By default, only players with a net <a href="series/2024/../../fun_money.html">Fun
Money</a> win show up on leaderboards, but if you've played
and have a net loss, you can see your entry by having the shift key
held down when you select an entry from the Leaderboard menu.</p>

<p>Since July 5th has no World Series of Poker tournament play, July 5th
is a <a href="https://www.barge.org/">BARGE</a> inspired structure, "SAM_6", a four game mix of:</p>

<p>"Sam_6" was the nickname of <a href="https://feldmanmortuary.com/tribute/details/4734/David-Lawful/obituary.html">David
Lawful</a>,
a generous member of BARGE.  He liked to play odd games, although he was a
formidable opponent in all and a BARGE main event winner (2013).</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>One player entered twice, using separate nicknames.  His second entry
took second place, but by mutual agreement we decided to not include his
second entry in the prize money.  I will make that explicit in future
series.</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>I botched and we played nine-handed, rather than eight-handed.
When I was setting up the the WSOP-Style series this year, I thought I
could re-use the structure from last year's #94, because I thought
they were the same event. They were the same in all respects, <em>except</em>
this year's event was 8-handed IRL (but 9-handed due to my mistake).
Oh well.</p>

<p>WYWAB stands for "Wish You Were At
<a href="https://www.barge.org/barge-2024-schedule">BARGE</a>".</p>
<p>WYWAB is an annual series of craftpoker.com tournaments where each
tournament uses the same structures (and typically same starting
times) as most of the tournaments that are spread at BARGE.</p>
<p>WYWAB tournaments are open to all and are free.</p>
<h2 id="no-prizes-or-awards-just-fun-money"><a class="header" href="#no-prizes-or-awards-just-fun-money">No prizes or awards, just Fun Money</a></h2>
<p>Unlike previous years, in 2024, there are No prizes, or

<h2 id="the-tournaments-5"><a class="header" href="#the-tournaments-5">The Tournaments</a></h2>
<p>All times on this page are in the Pacific Daylight Saving Time time
zone.  In the craftpoker.com lobby, all times are in the time zone
your is browser configured for (probably your local time zone).  So,
if you're not going to play in the Pacific DST time zone, you'll need
to either convert from Pacific or use the lobby to figure out when
each tournament starts.</p>
<p>Each tournament row in the following table contains two links.

<h2 id="some-differences-1"><a class="header" href="#some-differences-1">Some Differences</a></h2>
<p>Mb2, the software used to run the tournaments is very flexible, but
it doesn't (yet?) know how to deal a Funbook tournament, nor does
it support CHORSE or Chinese Poker.  As such, those three tournaments
are not part of WYWAB 2024.  Similarly, mb2 doesn't deal shoot-outs,
so the Triple Stud tournament is a Freezeout.</p>
<p>For the tournaments that are dealt, some differences are just to
improve the online experience and keep the tournaments from taking too
long:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Except for Five Card PLO and the Tournament of Champions style tournament, rounds
last five minutes.  Five Card PLO rounds are six minutes and fifteen seconds.
Tournament of Champions style tournament
has five minute Hold'em rounds, six minute Stud rounds
and seven minute twenty seconds Omaha/8 rounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are no chip races.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breaks start "on the 55", which means that once each table has finished
a hand after fifty-five minutes after the hour, all tables will get a five
minute break.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These differences, however, are due to a lack of planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In each tournament with a big blind ante, the antes are posted
<em>before</em> the big blind.  That meant that if you only have a fraction of
the big blind after paying the ante, you are only able to win the
ante plus the amount of chips you got when you multiplied that
fraction of the big blind by the number of players who had also put in
that much or more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently, rebuy and add-on support in mb2 is pretty weak.
Specifically, add-ons cost the same amount as the entry, so for the
"NLHE &amp; PLO Double Board Bomb Pot (w/ rebuys)" tournament, the buy-in
is FM 60 so that the rebuys will also be FM 60.  Additionally,
all the rebuy FM goes into the prize pool (mb2 does not yet implement
vig or charity diversions).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mb2 does not yet know how to change the number of seats for the final
table, so all final tables will have the number of seats as the tournament
starts with.  So, "NLHE &amp; PLO Double Board Bomb Pot (w/ rebuys)" will have
an eight handed final table, whereas at BARGE it will be nine handed.
HOT's final table will be six, not seven. TOC-Style will have an eight
handed final table, as opposed to nine.</p>

<p>WYWAE stands for "Wish You Were At
<a href="https://www.barge.org/schedule1">EMBARGO</a>".</p>
<p>The WYWAE series is an
mb2 tournament dealt for each of the EMBARGO tournaments.</p>
<p>In 2025, there are no cash prizes.</p>
<p>There has never been (and never will be) an entry fee.  It's a
freeroll, although in 2025 it's a freeroll for bragging rights.</p>
<h2 id="the-tournaments-6"><a class="header" href="#the-tournaments-6">The Tournaments</a></h2>
<p>All seven tournaments will be held in January.</p>
<p>The first is on Thursday the 16th at 6pm Pacific.  The following three days each have two tournaments, one at 11am Pacific the other at 6pm Pacific.</p>
<p>The times listed in this table are all in Pacific Standard, since
that's the time zone of Las Vegas at this time of year.</p>
<p>In the mb2 lobby, the times will be in the time zone your
browser is configured for (which—for most people—is your
local time zone).</p>
<p>Each of the <strong>times</strong> (i.e., under the <code>Times</code> heading) in the table
below is a link to the corresponding page of the EMBARGO 2024
Structure Sheet. Each of the events is a link to the mb2 structure
sheet which will actually be used.  This is very important for CHAOS,
because the WYWAE CHAOS event is quite different from the EMBARGO
Chaos No Limit Hold'em event.</p>
<p>Although the EMBARGO Structure Sheet is provided as a reference, this
series is not sanctioned, endorsed or in any other way sponsored or
related to the BARGE organization.  It is being put on by Craft Poker Co.,
a completely unrelated corporation.</p>

<p>Each event has an FM 100 buy-in. Mb2 accounts are allowed to go
negative, so you do not need Fun Money to enter or re-enter.  The
Bounty PLO tournament has an FM 150 buy-in so that FM 50 can be paid
as a bounty each time someone busts.</p>

<h3 id="breaks-at-55-past-the-hour-1"><a class="header" href="#breaks-at-55-past-the-hour-1">Breaks at 55 past the hour</a></h3>
<p>The WYWAE breaks will begin after each table has finished a hand at or after 55 minutes
after the hour. The break will then be five minutes long.</p>
<h3 id="late-registration-2"><a class="header" href="#late-registration-2">Late Registration</a></h3>
<p>In the WYWAE tournaments, late registration will be allowed through level 9.</p>
<h3 id="re-entries-1"><a class="header" href="#re-entries-1">Re-entries</a></h3>
<p>During WYWAE tournaments, you may re-enter up to two times, through level 9 for
all tournaments except CHAOS, which allows up to five re-entries.  If that is
too chaotic for you, don't play.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>

<p>Ring games, also known as cash games (even though no cash is involved),
are the non-tournament form of poker.</p>
<p>In a Ring Game, you choose how much of your Fun Money you want to
bring to the table, where it's converted to chips.  You then play at
the table as long as you want and when you leave your chips are converted
back to Fun Money. If you gain chips at the table, then when you leave
you'll have gained Fun Money, but if you lose chips at the table, the
net effect will be that you lost Fun Money.</p>
<h2 id="not-supported-yet"><a class="header" href="#not-supported-yet">Not Supported Yet</a></h2>
<p>Although there's a brief description of Ring Games here and a few
mentions of them elsewhere in this Players' Manual, Ring Games are
currently unsupported.  The server knows a bit—but definitely
not all—about Ring Games but the client knows very little.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="vacation"><a class="header" href="#vacation">Vacation</a></h1>
<h2 id="turn-based"><a class="header" href="#turn-based">Turn Based</a></h2>
<p>Poker is turn-based. All poker games have at least one round of
betting where players with uncommitted chips must act, e.g., fold,
call, bet or raise.  Some poker games also have rounds where cards are
"manipulated" (for want of a better term), e.g. discarded or exchanged
for new cards.</p>
<p>Although action and manipulation is done in a specific order, in most
cases the user interface allows a player to tell the server how that
player wants to act or manipulate in advance. When it is a players
turn to act or manipulate, if that player has a valid advanced request
pending, it is used.</p>
<h2 id="being-put-on-vacation"><a class="header" href="#being-put-on-vacation">Being Put On Vacation</a></h2>
<p>If it is a player's turn and that player doesn't have an advanced request,
a timer is started and that player must do whatever is required for
that turn before the timer runs out our that payer is put on vacation.</p>
<p>If a player is put on vacation when it is a player's time to act, that
player will check if checking is an option. If checking is not an option,
that player will fold.</p>
<p>If a player is put on vacation when it is a player's time to manipulate
the player's cards, the minimal manipulation possible will be done.  For
example, if a player has the option of standing pat (i.e. not discarding
or exchanging any cards), that' what the player will do.  However, if a
player must discard a card, the server will choose a card to discard.</p>
<h3 id="how-the-server-decides-which-cards-to-manipulate"><a class="header" href="#how-the-server-decides-which-cards-to-manipulate">How the Server Decides Which Cards to Manipulate</a></h3>
<p>If the server has to choose a card for manipulation, it will not take
the rank or suit or other cards into consideration. In other words,
the server will not try to make a good choice for you, nor will it try
to make a bad choice for you.</p>
<h2 id="a-vacationed-player-may-win-a-hand"><a class="header" href="#a-vacationed-player-may-win-a-hand">A Vacationed Player May Win a Hand</a></h2>
<p>It is possible for a player to win a hand on vacation, but only if the
player starts the hand not on vacation.  The act of being put on
vacation doesn't fold a player, so if a player is put on vacation and
can check for the rest of the hand, that player's hand will still be
live at the showdown.</p>
<h2 id="starting-on-vacation"><a class="header" href="#starting-on-vacation">Starting On Vacation</a></h2>
<p>If, however, a player starts a hand on vacation, that player's hand will
be folded before showdown.</p>
<h2 id="no-show"><a class="header" href="#no-show">No Show</a></h2>
<p>In a tournament, if a player goes on vacation before acting or
manipulating, that player is considered a no-show until that player
does act or manipulate.  While a player is considered a no-show, the
player's hand will be folded before the first round of action or
manipulation.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chat"><a class="header" href="#chat">Chat</a></h1>
<p>The lobby and the table windows allow you to type messages.</p>
<p>Messages typed in the lobby can be seen by anyone logged in or anyone
who logs in in the next twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Lobby chat can sometimes be a bit confusing because there may be a big
lag between when someone asks a question and someone else responds.
As such, the original question will no longer appear once it times
out, which could leave an answer stranded. For this reason, lobby chat
messages have timestamps that can be seen by hovering over the chat
line.</p>
<p>Messages typed in tables can be seen by anyone playing at or
observing those tables.  Observers can be logged in or anonymous.</p>
<p>All chat is preceded by the nickname of the author of the chat. Normal
messages then have a colon before the message. Action messages do not
have the colon.</p>
<h2 id="special-formatting"><a class="header" href="#special-formatting">Special Formatting</a></h2>
<h3 id="action-messages"><a class="header" href="#action-messages">Action Messages</a></h3>
<p>If you preface your message with "/me ", your message will be
displayed in italics.  E.g., if I type</p>
<blockquote>

<p>the output will be</p>

<h3 id="links"><a class="header" href="#links">Links</a></h3>
<p>You can create a link that other people can click on by surrounding the
label for the link in <code>[]</code> and then, with no space after the closing <code>]</code>,
putting the complete URL within <code>()</code>.  E.g., if I type</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Craft Poker Co. is [now online](https://craftpoker.com/).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the output will be</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Craft Poker Co. is <a href="https://craftpoker.com/">now online</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only URLs that start with <code>http://</code>, <code>https://</code> or <code>mailto:</code> can be
used inside the parentheses. If the text inside the parentheses doesn't
start with those schemes or is not a valid URL, then mb2 will simply
pass the text through, so if you type</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[test](link)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the output will be</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[test](link)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At some point <a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues/907">mb2 will detect failed attempts at
links</a>, but that's not yet
a high priority.</p>
<h3 id="emojis"><a class="header" href="#emojis">Emojis</a></h3>
<p>You can either type (or paste) emojis in as utf-8 or you can use <a href="https://emojipedia.org/github/">GitHub
emoji shortcodes</a>, but only for the GitHub
emojis that have a Unicode representation<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.  E.g., if I
type</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yup! I hit my two outer. :grinning:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the output will be</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yup! I hit my two outer. 😀</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Unfortunately, I know of no nicely structured list of that GitHub
emoji subset and the <a href="https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908">gist that shows <em>all</em> GitHub emoji
shortcodes</a> leads with
:bowtie: which <em>does not</em> have a Unicode representation. Luckily,
the vast majority of the emojis in that list are indeed represented
by Unicode.</p>
</div>
<p>Additionally, if you want to use that list, you might be able to tell
whether a particular emoji has a Unicode representation by hovering
your mouse over the emoji. Try doing that with the bowtie emoji and
almost any other emoji on that page and you may see that your cursor
turns to an I-beam for emojis with a Unicode representation (e.g.,
:smile:) but remains an arrow for one of the ones that doesn't work
(e.g., :bowtie:).</p>

<p>Mb2 can deal sixty-four different variations of poker<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. This includes
common ones like Texas Hold'em, Omaha and Seven Card Stud as well as
lesser known games like Badugi, Courchevel and Big O.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.barge.org/rulebook/">BARGE Rule Book</a> has
rules to almost all of the games mb2 deals.  The exceptions are

<a href="./games/regular-pineapple.html">Regular Pineapple</a>,

<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>At the time of this writing, the precise—but perhaps inaccurate—number of games is sixty-seven. That number comes from the source code to mb2:</p>

<p>The 64 shows that we're populating the <code>GAMES</code> constant with 64
elements, but it's counting <code>Hold'em</code> and <code>Hold'em High/Low with an Eight Qualifier</code> as two separate games.</p>
<p>It's also making the distinction between <code>Crazy Pineapple</code> and <code>Lazy Pineapple</code>, yet collectively those <em>two</em> games count as <em>three</em> (and
not four!) because it has a separate entry for Lazy Pineapple with an
eight qualifier and Lazy Pineapple without an eight qualifier, but
does not do the same for Crazy Pineapple.</p>
<p>Internally, games are implemented as core games[^2] which can have a
lot of options applied to them and the <code>GAMES</code> constant simply
represents the most popular combinations of core games with
options. There is no requirement for a combination of a core game and
options to be present in <code>GAMES</code> for that combination to be used in a
tournament structure or ring game, so mb2 is already dealing well more
than sixty different variants, but some of the differences are so
small that it's hard to argue they're different games.</p>
<p>[^2]
At the time of this writing, here are the core games, with up to three
examples of each.  This table is mostly to represent the current flexibility
of mb2. As such, it's not really that useful to Players, per-se.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lammers"><a class="header" href="#lammers">Lammers</a></h1>
<p>Some of the tournament structures (typically limited to big-bet)
include lammers in addition to starting chips.  Each lammer is worth a
fixed amount and can be used in four different ways:</p>
<h3 id="redemption-before-the-first-hand"><a class="header" href="#redemption-before-the-first-hand">Redemption Before the First Hand</a></h3>
<p>If you want to redeem any of your lammers before the first hand, you
must use the "extra options" menu from the lobby that's the rightmost
column in the upcoming tournaments area.  The leftmost column is the
check-box that you use to join.  The rightmost column is a down
chevron that has a drop-down menu associated with it.  When a
tournament uses lammers, that drop-down allows you to specify how many
of the lammers you want to redeem before the start of the first hand.</p>
<h3 id="manual-redemption-during-the-game"><a class="header" href="#manual-redemption-during-the-game">Manual Redemption During The Game</a></h3>
<p>The redeem command (requires use of the command text box) takes a
single numeric argument that specifies how many lammers you wish to
redeem (e.g., <code>redeem 2</code>).</p>
<p>If you are in a hand, the redemption will happen at the end of that
hand.  If you have a redemption scheduled for the end of the hand and
you change your mind you can use <code>redeem 0</code>.</p>
<p>If you're not in a hand, the redemption will happen immediately and can
not be reverted.</p>
<h3 id="resurrection"><a class="header" href="#resurrection">Resurrection</a></h3>
<p>If you bust and you have one or more lammers left, exactly one lammer
will be cashed in and you'll be back in the game with the amount of
chips that lammer is worth.</p>
<h3 id="forced-redemption"><a class="header" href="#forced-redemption">Forced Redemption</a></h3>
<p>Typically there's a final level where lammers are allowed and if you
finish that level, all lammers you have are redeemed for you (and all
your opponents) automatically.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="github"><a class="header" href="#github">GitHub</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/about">GitHub</a> is a wonderful service for
programmers, but if you don't already know what it is, you <em>probably</em>
don't want to join it just to use your GitHub account to log in to
Mb2, but you can if you want.</p>
<p>Mb2 currently supports signing-on (and signing-up) via GitHub as a
proof-of-concept for allowing logging in through social media.  GitHub
was chosen to be first because Mb2's user interface currently is
"sub-optimal" (<code>/me chuckles</code>) and as such the next tranche to be
exposed to Mb2 are likely to be people who can look beyond the
surface, e.g., programmers.</p>
<p>If you sign-in via GitHub, your account's canonical name will be your
GitHub account's name canonicalized. You can customize your nickname by
putting the customization in the <code>Nickname</code> field of the sign-up and then
clicking the <code>Login with GitHub</code> button. Your customization will only
be accepted if it is compatible with your canonicalized name.</p>
<p>As an example of customization, if your GitHub account name is <code>ctm</code> and
you put <code>Ctm!</code> in the <code>Nickname</code> field, then when you're logged in, your
nickname will be <code>Ctm!</code>. If, however, you put <code>deadhead</code> in the <code>Nickname</code>
field, then your nickname will simply be the unadorned <code>ctm</code>.</p>
<p>FWIW, GitHub hosts the <a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/tree/master/src">source to this Player's
Manual</a>, this Player's
Manual itself, <a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues">Mb2's issue
tracker</a> and the source to mb2
(in a private repository).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="table-balancing"><a class="header" href="#table-balancing">Table Balancing</a></h1>
<p>When there are three or more tables in a tournament, mb2 will keep the
player counts of each table within two of each other. It will do this
by moving one player at the end of the hand from a table that has more
than two more players than the smallest table.  The player that is
moved will be the player that has the worst position (e.g., about to
take the big blind). That player will be moved into the worst
position.  As such, that player will not move into a worse position
than that player would have been in anyway.</p>
<p>When there are enough empty seats to accommodate all the players in the
smallest table, that table will be broken. The players at the broken
table will be assigned to other tables at random.</p>
<p>When there are two tables, mb2 will keep the player counts of each of the
two tables within one of each other.  It will rebalance the same way
that is done when there are more than two tables.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sevens-rule"><a class="header" href="#sevens-rule">Sevens Rule</a></h1>
<h2 id="sevens-rule-definition"><a class="header" href="#sevens-rule-definition">Sevens Rule Definition</a></h2>
<p>The Sevens Rule applies only to California Lowball. It is simply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the draw, if you have a seven or better, you may not check it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the purposes of the Sevens Rule, calling an amount that is less
than the post-draw bet size is considered a check. The only way that
can happen is if the first player to bet goes all-in for less than the
post-draw bet size.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="penalty"><a class="header" href="#penalty">Penalty</a></h1>
<h2 id="sevens-rule-penalty"><a class="header" href="#sevens-rule-penalty">Sevens Rule Penalty</a></h2>
<p>The penalty is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After violating the Sevens Rule, further action from that player,
for the remainder of that hand, will be lost or returned. It will
never increase the amount to be won above the amount to be won
pre-violation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a player checks a seven and subsequently folds or loses the hand,
there is no penalty, because that player would not win anything
anyway.</p>
<p>However, if a player checks a seven, post-draw, and shows the best
hand, all of that player's post-check action is returned to the
player.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if no other hand tied the best hand shown by the
violator, then everyone's action beyond that check, from any pot that
includes that hand, is returned.</p>
<p>If there is a tie between one or more Sevens Rule violators and one or
more Sevens Rule followers, the post-draw action of the Sevens Rule
violators is returned to the violators and the remaining amount in the
pot is awarded to the non-violator (or split evenly if more than one
non-violator has a tying winning hand).</p>

<p>BARGE stands for the Big August Rec.Gambling Excursion.  It's an event
that's been held annually since 1990.</p>
<p>You don't need to know anything about BARGE to use mb2, but BARGE and
BARGErs have strongly influenced mb2.  It is no coincidence that
almost all the games mb2 currently knows how to deal occur in the
<a href="barge/rule_book.html">BARGE Rule Book</a>.</p>
<p>In 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, BARGE was held online using an
incredibly primitive version of mb2. So far, <a href="https://www.barge.org/barge-2020">those
tournaments</a> are the largest ones
mb2 has dealt to actual people.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="barge-rule-book"><a class="header" href="#barge-rule-book">BARGE Rule Book</a></h1>
<p>Written by BARGE's very own CMeck, the BARGE Rule Book was updated
annually through 2021 to contain all the games to be played in the BARGE
tournaments, with games from previous years moved to a different
section of the rule book.</p>
<p>The 2021 version of the rule book is available at

<p>In 2023, the interactive BARGE Rule Book was taken down and replaced
with a PDF. Although the 2021 version of the interactive rule book can
still be found on archive.org, mb2 links to the PDF version since that's
the one at barge.org.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWIIQ-FO8ic">Loser</a>) involve
gambling, both metaphorically and actually playing poker.</p>
<p>On March 26th, 1983 the Grateful Dead <a href="https://archive.org/details/gd1983-03-26.140315.sbd.eaton.miller.clugston.flac1648">played Las
Vegas</a>.
I drove out to see them.  I had a great time and wound up fascinated
by the video poker machine in the Best Western.  So, once I got back to
Albuquerque, I wrote my own video poker software.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="programming-poker-on-the-internet"><a class="header" href="#programming-poker-on-the-internet">Programming Poker on the internet</a></h1>
<p>I do not remember whether I found IRC poker before or after I found Roy's
C library for evaluating poker hands, but they both were a pleasant
distraction from the Macintosh emulation and reverse engineering that
occupied the vast majority of my time in the early nineties.</p>
<h2 id="hand-evaluators"><a class="header" href="#hand-evaluators">Hand Evaluators</a></h2>
<h3 id="roy-hashimoto"><a class="header" href="#roy-hashimoto">Roy Hashimoto</a></h3>
<p>Roy wrote C software to evaluate poker hands and to iterate through a deck
to compute various odds.  I, and others, found various ways to speed up
Roy's code.</p>
<h3 id="mat-hostetter"><a class="header" href="#mat-hostetter">Mat Hostetter</a></h3>
<p>Mat observed that there was a lot of information to be gained by
viewing a hand as four 13-bit numbers (each 13-bit number
representing the ranks present for each of the four suits) and then
doing a bitwise-or of those four numbers. With Hostetter's Observation
he was able to code up what was the fastest hand evaluator at the
time.  I did some of the grunt work.</p>
<h3 id="steve-brecher"><a class="header" href="#steve-brecher">Steve Brecher</a></h3>
<p>Steve also did some poker programming and it was always a delight to bounce
ideas off of him.</p>
<h3 id="michael-maurer-and-brian-goetz"><a class="header" href="#michael-maurer-and-brian-goetz">Michael Maurer and Brian Goetz</a></h3>
<p>Michael and Brian created what was at the time the most elaborate library

<h3 id="andrew-prock"><a class="header" href="#andrew-prock">Andrew Prock</a></h3>
<p>Andrew took on and conquered some of the combinatorical explosions
that crop up when doing enumerations.  He used techniques that
generated perfect odds but called the enumerators far fewer times.
His pokerstove was (and presumably still is) the fastest calculator of
such odds.</p>

<h3 id="todd-mummert-and-greg-reynolds"><a class="header" href="#todd-mummert-and-greg-reynolds">Todd Mummert and Greg Reynolds</a></h3>
<p>Todd wrote the bot that <a href="https://www.pokerlistings.com/blog/the-first-online-poker-room-irc-poker">dealt poker on an IRC
server</a>
at CMU.  IRC poker was social, but many people honed their game by
taking it semi-seriously.</p>
<p>IRC was text-only, but Greg was able to build a Graphical User Interface
on top of it (although I used only the text interface).</p>

<h2 id="barge-1"><a class="header" href="#barge-1">BARGE</a></h2>
<p>In 1994, I attended my first <a href="https://www.barge.org/">BARGE</a>. The organizers
did an excellent job putting the event together and my fellow BARGErs were
welcoming, fun, interesting and knowledgeable.</p>
<h3 id="organizers-emeritus-michael-zimmers-and-chuck-weinstock"><a class="header" href="#organizers-emeritus-michael-zimmers-and-chuck-weinstock">Organizers Emeritus Michael Zimmers and Chuck Weinstock</a></h3>
<p>Michael attended his first BARGE in 1992 when it was still
semi-spontaneous.  Chuck's first was 1993.</p>
<p>Since 1994 was my first BARGE, and since BARGE would come to be a
minor influence on multibot and a huge influence on mb2, these two
organizers get explicit thanks here.  Michael and Chuck have also
been playing on mb2 since the early days and are two of the most
frequent players.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="multibot"><a class="header" href="#multibot">Multibot</a></h1>
<p>Todd's server did not (initially?) deal tournaments, but, if I
remember correctly, some of us chose to create the tournament
experience by starting at a table and raising the blinds as we played.
There were many drawbacks to these (up to 23-players for Hold'em)
tounaments.</p>
<p>On Halloween 1998, I wrote the core of "multibot", an IRC bot to deal
multi-table tournaments.  I did it on Halloweeen because I knew that the
constant interruption from trick-or-treaters would preclude me from doing
Macintosh emulation work that required serious concentration.</p>
<p>Although multibot's core was initially in C, I soon rewrote multibot
in Objective-C, a language that I had to use to port
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executor_(software)">Executor</a> to
NeXTSTEP.  I wound up liking Objective-C and used multibot as a
vehicle to help me learn it better.</p>
<h2 id="i-needed-money"><a class="header" href="#i-needed-money">I needed money</a></h2>
<p>I had planned on making multibot open source, but I had a loan that I
I needed to pay back.</p>

<h4 id="the-napolitanos"><a class="header" href="#the-napolitanos">The Napolitanos</a></h4>
<p>So, I wound up selling multibot to the Napolitanos where it became the server
for Poker School Online.</p>

<p>I had no intention of returning to the poker software business.  I

several other opportunities to pursue.  However…</p>

building Open Source.</p>
<h2 id="serious-time-sinks"><a class="header" href="#serious-time-sinks">Serious Time Sinks</a></h2>
<p>I don't want to encourage addiction.  I've heard about it from a developer
and seen it in players.</p>
<h3 id="anonymous-mmo-developer"><a class="header" href="#anonymous-mmo-developer">Anonymous MMO developer</a></h3>
<p>A friend of mine was a lead developer on an MMO.  Well after the MMO
was released, he heard from several people that they had spent way too
much time on that MMO. It was sufficiently addicting that they felt
they had lost far too much their life and somehow he was to blame.</p>
<h3 id="anonymous-mmo-players"><a class="header" href="#anonymous-mmo-players">Anonymous MMO players</a></h3>
<p>A couple other friends of mine got very active in an MMO and…
eventually decided that they had wasted months, if not years, of their
time due to the addictiveness of this game.</p>
<h2 id="rust-is-an-awesome-language"><a class="header" href="#rust-is-an-awesome-language">Rust is an awesome language</a></h2>
<p>I read a lot of good things about Rust and eventually I started
dabbling in it.  Eventually I started thinking about writing another
poker server.  By then Poker School Online had been bought by Poker
Stars and my software had been completely decommissioned, so I wouldn't
be competing with the people who bought multibot.</p>
<p>The more I played with Rust the more I wanted to learn (although to be
fair, there were days when Rust's steep learning curve was pretty
intimidating).</p>
<h2 id="my-daughters-liked-to-play-poker"><a class="header" href="#my-daughters-liked-to-play-poker">My daughters liked to play poker</a></h2>
<p>My wife and I used a bunch of the money I got from Poker School Online
to go through five rounds of in-vitro conception, resulting in three
children.  As they grew, I spent a little time playing an MMO with my
eldest: my son Elvis. For some reason my daughters enjoyed (at least
briefly) playing poker with me with real cards and cheap chips.</p>
<h3 id="margaret-and-iris"><a class="header" href="#margaret-and-iris">Margaret and Iris</a></h3>
<p>So, being terminally lazy—and wanting to learn Rust—I decided
to write software to deal poker rather than having to get out, play with
and put away actual cards and chips.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mb2"><a class="header" href="#mb2">Mb2</a></h1>
<p>Mb2 is my successor to multibot. The thought of creating a new poker ecosystem
rumbled around in my head for a while. In 2019, three days after running
the Boston Marathon, I pulled the trigger:</p>

<h3 id="barge-deadheads"><a class="header" href="#barge-deadheads">BARGE deadheads</a></h3>
<p>On May 7th, I shared my thoughts, concerns and need for play-testers
with the BARGE deadheads. I sent out an email with "return, maybe, of
IRC poker, sort of" as the subject and I got great feedback.</p>
<h3 id="wrgpt"><a class="header" href="#wrgpt"><a href="http://wrgpt.org/">WRGPT</a></a></h3>
<p>Although I knew how to play poker and have written a poker server
before, I knew that I might forget various edge cases, so one of the
first things I did was write a parser to allow me to read all the hand
histories from the most recent WRGPT.</p>
<p>I had wanted to do the same using IRC poker histories, but I couldn't
find any.  I wasn't even successful at finding documentation for the
IRC poker commands, so I leaned on the WRGPT advanced action documentation
when my memory was insufficient as I created mb2's underlying protocol.</p>
<h3 id="bill-savage"><a class="header" href="#bill-savage">Bill Savage</a></h3>
<p>In mid October, 2019, one of my friends volunteered to invest in my
project.  I've known Bill for a long time.  We used to follow the
Grateful Dead, often with him driving.  He was also my hiking partner
for many years.  He was around back when I formed Abacus Research &amp;
Development (my Macintosh emulation and reverse engineering company).</p>
<h3 id="lfromhell"><a class="header" href="#lfromhell">LFromHell</a></h3>
<p>The earliest version of mb2 used IRC as an interface and LFromHell was
essentially my only play-tester.  Others stepped in and tried it here and
there, but she came out regularly and even brought a friend or two.  Her
early support was critical to me getting mb2 off the ground.</p>
<h3 id="c-meck-and-the-barge-rule-book"><a class="header" href="#c-meck-and-the-barge-rule-book">C. Meck and the <a href="https://www.ceemeck.org/BARGERuleBook2021/">BARGE Rule Book</a></a></h3>
<p>Multibot only dealt a few games. I wanted mb2 to be more flexible, so
I implemented all of the games in the BARGE Rule Book, maintained by
Christoper J. Mecklin.</p>
<h3 id="rich-bremer"><a class="header" href="#rich-bremer">Rich Bremer</a></h3>
<p>Similarly, I wanted mb2 to be able to support a variety of tournament
structures, so I implemented the most recent tournament structures
dealt at BARGE and EMBARGO. They were created by Rich Bremer.</p>
<h3 id="lee-ward"><a class="header" href="#lee-ward">Lee Ward</a></h3>
<p>In mid August, 2020, another of my friends volunteered to invest in my
project.  Like Bill, I've known him since I was in the UNM MSCS
program.  So he too was around for the birth and death of ARDI (Abacus
Research &amp; Development).  What a long, strange trip it's been.</p>
<h3 id="patrick-milligan"><a class="header" href="#patrick-milligan">Patrick Milligan</a></h3>
<p>Patrick created mb2's deck.</p>
<h3 id="charles-haynes"><a class="header" href="#charles-haynes">Charles Haynes</a></h3>
<p>In mid May, 2021, I sought and found a third investor. Charles
got the deal via a simple reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm in."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ironically, as of mid March 2022, I haven't yet taken Charles's
money, because it's taken me a while (<em>far too long</em>) to
find a business attorney and to get various preferred shareholder
agreements written.  Since Charles can back out once the
paperwork is ready, that succinct reply has turned into (IMO) a big
freeroll.</p>
<h3 id="gerald-gerry-petersen-aka-gerdog"><a class="header" href="#gerald-gerry-petersen-aka-gerdog">Gerald (Gerry) Petersen aka gerdog</a></h3>
<p>Back when mb2 was still text only, Gerry started playing in our daily
tournaments. There have been other players who have played quite a
bit, but Gerry has been a constant presence and has provided many
good suggestions.</p>
<h3 id="nnr13"><a class="header" href="#nnr13">NNR13</a></h3>
<p>NNR13 is another early adopter. NNR13 has gracefully pointed out
several areas where mb2 could be (and has been) improved.  Furthermore,
NNR13 has consistently kept track of the health—physical
and mental—of the other players. It's always a delight to have
NNR13 present.</p>
<h3 id="dave-tall"><a class="header" href="#dave-tall">Dave Tall</a></h3>
<p>As I added a little bit of sound, here and there, to mb2, I poked
around and found various CC0 files to use. However, Dave Tall, a
fellow Albuquerquean played his trombone and recorded the game-change
fanfare and donated it to mb2.</p>
<h3 id="cc0-creators"><a class="header" href="#cc0-creators">CC0 creators</a></h3>
<p>Although mb2 is not currently stylized and most of the assets are

<p>Although I'm currently the sole programmer working on mb2, I use
GitHub's issue tracker to log what I need to do and what I've done.
Although mb2 itself is closed-source, I have a public
<a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc">mb2-doc</a> GitHub repository and that's
where I track mb2 issues.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, Ed has chosen to watch that repository and every
once in a while he comments on an issue, typically in commiseration.
To a large extent I try to live my life as though someone were
watching me, in other words, I behave well even when nobody can see
that I'm doing so. However, knowing that Ed may be following my

<p>An additional 1,520 shares of Series A Preferred Stock have been authorized
to be sold to accredited investors and through the Title3Funds Equity

<p>Series A Preferred shares come with a liquidity preference. Should CPC
or CPC's software be sold without conversion, the net of the sale is
split in half, with one half going to the Series A Preferred
Shareholders pro-rata and the other half going to the common stock
shareholders pro-rata<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Conversion happens only if at least one million dollars is raised at a

<p>Should conversion occur, the minimum value of each Series A Preffered
Share would be $10MM / 19,800 = $505.05, which is 2.88 times $175.</p>
<p>Were CPC sold for less than $10MM, each Series A Preffered Share would
be worth at least<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> the net of the sale divided by 8,100, so a
$1,417,500 net would be break-even, where a $3MM sale would return
$370 per share.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Another way of saying that is that Cliff gets
half of the proceeds and the other half is split amongst the Series A

<p>While Craft Poker Co. is the name of the company,
<a href="https://craftpoker.com">craftpoker.com</a> is the name of the site.</p>
<p>Here's a super abbreviated version of what I plan for craftpoker.com</p>
<ul>
<li>Play money only</li>
<li>Anyone can play for free, but only in public tournaments and public ring games</li>
<li>For $5/month (free for <a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues/579#issuecomment-1552163018">players whose id is 99 or less</a>) a player can create and administer a club</li>
<li>At the $5/month rate, each club's membership can include the player who creates the club and up to nine other members</li>
<li>The membership in a club is dynamic and members can be swapped in and out trivially</li>
<li>Larger clubs can be created by having some of the members also be paying customers (e.g., two paying members can have a club with eighteen non-paying members)</li>
<li>Or, larger clubs can be created by having the paying member pay more than $5/month (e.g. pay $10/month and have up to nineteen non-paying members)</li>
<li>Club activities can be public or private</li>
<li>There will be different ways to keep score, with tools for administering them</li>
<li>Administrators will be able to create their own tournament and ring game mixes (combinations of games played in rotation)</li>
<li>Administrators will be able to create their own tournament structures (starting chips, levels, blinds, breaks)</li>
<li>Paying members will also have more/better history &amp; statistics (this one is a bit hand-wavy, but, as an example, it may be that free players can only request hand histories from the last 24 hours, while paying members can request all their hand histories, etc.)</li>
<li>No other fees, no upselling, no buying of play chips</li>
<li>"No"<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> dark patterns
<ul>
<li>No collection of unnecessary user data</li>
<li>No selling, trading or sharing of user data</li>
<li>No ads</li>
<li>Trivial to quit</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assuming Craft Poker Co. has sufficient capital, while the above is being developed, there will also be great improvements to the User Interface, allowing mb2 to be played on tablets "soon" and the ability to play on phones being a high priority (albeit too far away for me to say more just yet).</li>
</ul>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>This requires rewording, because one could make a good argument
that closed source itself is a dark pattern. Similarly, the artificial
scarcity of low user-ids could be seen as a dark pattern rather than
simply a way to reward early adopters.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, October 27th, I sent email to a group of friends looking
to see which ones were potentially interested in investing in CPC. On
Tuesday October 29th, I posted essentially the same letter to a

essentially the same, with the sole difference being explained in the
Facebook post, I'm only including the Facebook post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Craft Poker Co. investment interest?</p>
<p>Below is a copy of what I posted to the BARGE mailing list on Wednesday, the 23rd. The only change I've made is I have fixed an error that was in my BARGE post where I had incorrectly listed the number of remaining shares as 2,530 instead of 1,520 (2,530 is the number of shares sold already).</p>
<p>FWIW, I feel weird posting this here, because by and large I don't participate on Facebook. I chose not to have a Facebook account until May of 2023 and since then I have mostly found it a time sink and to a lesser extent a source of social anxiety. Oh well, I hope you all understand.</p>
<p>========================================================================</p>
<p>Craft Poker Co. (CPC) has 1,520 remaining shares of Series A Preferred Stock to sell at $175 / share. I'd like to get a ballpark level of interest from BARGErs (and non-BARGErs, too, but at a lower priority).</p>
<p>The current ownership structure and the liquidity preference (i.e., the thing that makes these shares preferred) are described on the Craft Poker Co. page of mb2's Players' Manual. Please open and read that page.</p>
<p>Buying Series A Preferred shares is essentially a bet on me, with the work I've already done on mb2 as a backstop.</p>
<p>I believe that in the future, I will be able to find investment in CPC at a pre-investment valuation of ten million dollars or more (making each Series A Preferred share worth &gt; $500) and from there grow CPC into a respectable company, supporting both the freemium business craftpoker.com as well as white-labeled sites and other revenue streams.</p>
<p>If I'm wrong, and I have to liquidate CPC before we get that level of investment, then the liquidity preference means that the net proceeds of the sale are split in half, with half going to me and the other half being split pro-rata amongst the Series A Preferred shareholders. In such a liquidation, assuming all 1,520 Series A Preferred shares have been sold, the net liquidation break-even point (i.e., where each Series A Preferred share would be worth $175) is $1,417,500.</p>
<p>For contrast, consider the (I believe very unlikely) scenario where only an additional 100 Series A Preferred shares are sold. In that case, the break-even would be $920,500. So, a hand-wavy way of looking at things would be that the software I've already written is worth just a little less than a one million dollars, with the idea that I could make it worth half again as much with an investment of approximately a quarter of a million dollars.</p>
<p>I believe this is a good deal, but I believe a variety of weird things. I'm happy to explain why I think it's a good deal and to provide a lot more details, but I'd rather do that by answering questions and adding pages to the Players' Manual than overwhelm people with an even longer email.</p>
<p>The last time I sent an email like this out, I was only looking for accredited investors and was looking for a minimum of $5,000 investment. That went well. This time, I'm looking for interest from anyone--especially BARGErs--with the only minimum being a whole number of shares.</p>
<p>Having some idea of the level of interest from BARGErs will help me decide how best to spend my time to ensure that all 1,520 shares are sold "relatively" quickly. It will also allow me to finalize some elements of the SEC Form C that I need to submit to allow me to sell to non accredited investors. If all 1,520 shares can be sold to BARGErs, great! If not, I'll query some non-BARGErs, friends of BARGErs, friends of friends, etc.</p>
<p>Assuming there's at least one person interested, I'll create a spreadsheet with rows for each inquiry and send a private email acknowledgment. It'll take a while for me to get the various paperwork in place (everything takes longer when you're broke, and I'm beyond broke), but I'll provide updates off this list.</p>
<p>In addition to posting to the BARGE list, I will post on the PokerPeeps Facebook page. I will also be contacting a few BARGErs via email. I do not plan on sending anything to BARGE announce or the other xARGE mailing lists, just because I don't like spam and clutter. I do, however, hope that if you are reading this and you know an ARGEr that doesn't read the BARGE mailing list or all the PokerPeeps posts that you spread the word.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>At 9:12pm, Tuesday October 29th, I sent the following email to people who had
expressed interest in investing. The only change I have made is that I have
redacted my cell number.  If you're reading this and you think you should know
my cell number, send me email and I'll share it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is shorter than I expected it to be, but I did say I'd get something out today.</p>
<p>I've caught up on my investor related email, so anyone who has expressed interest is on my spreadsheet. There are currently nineteen people on the list, expressing interest in 116 shares, with a few people expressing interest in one share, one person for 20, a fifteen and four 10s.</p>
<p>It took me forever to post to Poker Peeps, but I finally did that, minutes ago. I have not yet sent out email to people who have expressed interest in investing previously, because I got caught up in non-work email.</p>
<p>If any interest trickles in, I'll reply ASAP and add people to the spreadsheet, but I probably won't try to track down others until I do two things that I can do now that I have an idea of the level of interest: contact CPC's business attorney and get our Stock Purchase Agreement up to date and contact Title 3 Funds to make sure that they still want CPC as a client. I should be able to get that done tomorrow.</p>
<p>If all goes well, you probably won't hear anything more from me about this for over a week, because I'll be getting "i"s dotted, "t"s crossed, working on the SEC "Form C" and doing more outreach. I also will be taking a little time off to go out and attempt the Deadman Peaks Trail 100 miler, which starts Saturday morning and ends Sunday late afternoon. It's only a two hour drive from here, so it won't consume as much of my time as the Javelina Jundred. It will, however, interfere with my sleep through Monday.</p>
<p>My cell is <strong>[Redacted]</strong>. I sometimes get a bit behind in email, so if you ever need to get in touch with me and email doesn't work, try texting me.</p>

<p>On Sunday, November 17th, I received the <a href="craft-poker-co/updates/../stock-purcahse-agreement.docx">Stock Purchase
Agreement</a> from our business
attorney.  Unfortunately, I was a bit tired (and unbeknownst to me
at the time, slightly sick) when I received it, so I didn't make it
immediately available.  Turns out, I had covid, which I gave to my
ninety-two year old mother and that caused a lot of problems<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<details>
<summary>Mom's Status (slipping into dementia)</summary>
<p>Physically, mom is completely recovered from covid as you can see by
<a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/137430788">her Strava activity</a> (or
just trust me if you don't have a Strava account). However, mentally
she took a hit that is worrisome.</p>
<p>People on the BARGE mailing list may know that my mom stuffered a
stroke on March 27th, 2024.  On April 13th, after she was released
from ICU -&gt; Hospital Room -&gt; Inpatient Rehab, she was no longer fit to
live alone. My sister lived with her until June 3rd, when I took
over. I've been there ever since, although I've been spelled by my
sister or wife here and there.</p>
<p>Mom's mental acuity and memory were slowly starting to fail
pre-stroke.  They both took a huge hit with her stroke, but she
regained <em>much of</em>—but not all—she had lost, before
I gave her covid.</p>
<p>IMO, without the stroke and without covid, mom would have been sliding
slowly into dementia.  The stroke made things worse, with a big dip
followed by a rebound. Covid was a smaller dip and so far, a smaller
rebound.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>My Status (healthy, and adjusting)</summary>
<p>I still have a great immune system and probably never would have
gotten covid had I not done a twenty-four hour race in the drinking
division (meaning I had to drink a beer before each hilly four mile
loop) on November 8th<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.  FWIW, I've done that race several times
before without getting sick, but I've lost fitness since I've become
my mother's minder.</p>
<p>When both mom and I had covid at the same time, I still had to tend to
her and her ancient cat, which slowed my recovery.  I only missed a
few trainings, but I did get very tired every afternoon for a while.
Now my afternoon tiredness has returned to "normal" (normal for me),
which is dependent on how much quality sleep I got the night before.</p>
<p>Before covid, I had begun reprogramming myself to work efficiently in
the presence of a zillion tiny interruptions per-day.  During covid it
almost seemed hopeless as everything ground to a halt.  Now that we're
both through it, I'm continuing to tweak my schedule and habits to be
effective even in the absence of large blocks of uninterrupted time
(FTR, that mostly means not goofing off at the beginning of each work
block).</p>
</details>
<h2 id="title3-funds-is-a-go"><a class="header" href="#title3-funds-is-a-go">Title3 Funds is a go!</a></h2>
<p>So, even with the Stock Purchase Agreement in hand, I did not send
email to <a href="https://www.title3funds.com/">Title3 Funds</a> until I was
pretty sure that both mom and I were fully recovered (except her
increase in dementia).  I got a promising reply Friday the thirteenth
and it took a few days to schedule and have a call, but that happened
yesterday morning (Tuesday the seventeenth of December) and we're moving
forward.</p>
<p>I'd say "all steam ahead", except it's both the holidays and the end
of the year, both of which slow things down. Title3 Funds needs a few
things:</p>
<ol>
<li>reviewed financial statements</li>
<li>completion of <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/formc.pdf">SEC Form C</a><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup></li>
<li>marketing materials</li>
</ol>
<p>The financial statements have to come from CPC's accountant and I don't
yet know how long that will take. I <em>think</em> it can be done without much
effort, because CPC has had no income and the accountant has already
prepared CPC's 2022 and 2023 tax returns.</p>
<p>I've already completed about 80% of the Form C, but I'll need a little
help from our business attorney (and maybe the accountant) to double check
a few things.</p>
<p>I can do the marketing materials myself.  They'll suck, but I think
they'll be good enough.  Only one way to find out.  Spoiler: it'll
largely be a rewording of what I've already said, because although I'm
literally years behind schedule, the overall plan hasn't changed.</p>
<p>While working on the above three things, I'll also continue working on
mb2, albeit mostly working on the <a href="https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22high+priority%22+label%3Abug">bug
backlog</a>
rather than adding functionality.</p>
<p>I'm ashamed that I let so much time pass between my last status report
and this one.  I have found that if I really want to get stuff done, I
need to block out explicit time to do it and I'm especially bad at
sending status reports because I want them to be all-singing,
all-dancing and there's typically always one thing that is just about
to happen that I am willing to wait for.  My solution is to write my
status reports on Wednesdays, up at my house, after doing my
<a href="https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March/blob/master/2025.md#user-content-dec-18">Wednesday ruck speed
run</a>,
when I'm caffeinated AF.</p>
<p>Whee!</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Covid is a complicated subject and writing a status report that
provides "the right" amount of information is not something I can do
quickly (or perhaps at all).  I'm acutely aware that "caused a lot of
problems" sounds flip if not actually callous, but I want my opening
paragraph to summarize the reason for the delay as well as to not hide
challenges.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>I'd rather document my lack of judgment and foresight than to
sweep it under the rug, especially since anyone following <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/58696205">me on
Strava</a> and/or reading my
<a href="https://github.com/ctm/diet/tree/master/log">diet log</a> would already
know about this.</p>

<p>Statement of Purpose</p>
<p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").</p>
<p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
part through the use and efforts of others.</p>
<p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.</p>
<ol>
<li>Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
limited to, the following:</li>
</ol>
<p>i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
communicate, and translate a Work;
ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
likeness depicted in a Work;
iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
in a Work;
vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
protection of databases, and under any national implementation
thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
implementations thereof.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limitations and Disclaimers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
Work.
d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
this CC0 or use of the Work.
