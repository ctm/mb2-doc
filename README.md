# Mb2

Mb2 is Cliff Matthews's poker software.

If you don't like reading, you can go to
[https://devctm.com:8081](https://devctm.com:8081 "Pre-alpha")
and start playing now.

Eventually mb2 will have slick skinnable clients for a variety of
platforms, but it's being developed from the inside out, so although
it has excellent game mechanics, its UI is currently amazingly bad:

![Horrible Text-base Interface](./table-with-advanced-action-check-boxes.png "Room for Improvement")
Although all of the advanced action possibilities are exposed through
the rudimentary set of check-boxes, other things a player might need
to do (e.g., discard cards) still require the command line.

### Closed source

Mb2 is closed source, because it's hard to put toothpaste back in the
tube.  I'm monetizing mb2 and exploring closed source solutions first.
I'm also investigating ways in which I can make the source open, but
it's trivial to go from closed to open and impossible to do the
reverse.

### Public documentation

This repository exists primarily as a place for me to publicly [track
issues](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues) as friends and family
use mb2.  Secondarily, it has a little more documentation than is
provided by the help commands from the client.

## Web-only (mostly text-only interface using pop-ups)

Mb2 is temporarily accessed via a mostly-text web interface.  I'm
slowly adding UI elements.  However, I'm not a visual person, so I'm
making no attempt to do graphic design.  Instead, I'm slowly scraping
up some investment to pay a professional front-end developer or two to
create something elegant and ergonomic.

### Pop-ups used for tables

When you first log in, you're in the starting pen, a place where
people can crudely set up and start tournaments.  Once a tournament is
started, all players registered for that tournament will get a
pop-up window for the table that they're assigned to, unless their
browser blocks pop-ups.  If the browser blocks the table pop-up,
a dialog will appear that tells you what happened and allows you
to click on an "OK" button to allow you to see your table.

Using a pop-up for the table allows people to be on multiple tables at
once.  So it's slightly more convenient if you set your browser to
allow https://devctm.com:8081 to create pop-ups, but it's not
necessary; allowing pop-ups just skips the need to click on an "OK"
button when a tournament starts.

### Shareable links

When you're playing on a table, the url that is displayed
(e.g. `https://devctm.com:8081/event/2/player/2`) is shareable.
Anyone who follows that link is then connected to the server with an
anonymous read-only view of the table you're playing on. If you get
transferred to another table, the your observers will be transferred
too.

Eventually you'll be connected to a nice page that has a graphical
view of the table as well as some information about what you're
observing and how to create an account so that you can play yourself
or at least root the person on you're observing.  For now, the url
sharing is proof-of-concept.

### Usernames

Currently, you create a username simply by filling in a desired
username and a password.  If that username is available, the password
is remembered in the database and nobody else can use that username
with a different password.  If you try to use a username that already
has a password assigned to it, you'll not be able to log in and be
told that you supplied an invalid password.

Before a username is placed in the database, it is canonicalized by
removing all characters that aren't alphanumeric and translating the
alphabetic characters to lower-case.  However, whatever you type when
you log in is what the other players see, so although you can't change
the canonical form of your username, you can mix it up by changing
which characters are upper-case and which are lower.  You can also add
white-space and emojis, although [emojis interfere with the primitive
character alignment](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues/104) that's
currently used, so don't use emojis yet.

So, for example, if you create an account by typing `TestUser` in the
Username box, after you log out (by closing your lobby window/tab) you
can then log in with `testuser` or `TEST user` or even `Test User ðŸ˜Ž`.
For the record, although this is a deliberate feature, I can't
guarantee that we'll keep it.  It may wind up being too confusing
and/or annoying.

### Player Ids

When you share a url, people can see your player id.  However, be
aware that devctm.com is a staging server and the player id that you
use on devctm.com will not necessarily be the player id you'll get on
the production site. However, player ids 1 through 9 are an exception.
I have already handed them out to some of the people who have greatly
increased the chance of me having written this server, even though
their influence has mostly been indirect.

I will reward early play-testers with low player ids on craftpoker.com
when it goes live.  On https://devctm.com:8081 player ids are handed
out sequentially, but the database is recording enough information for
for me to know who is testing and who isn't.  I'll use that, and other,
info to hand out ids 90-99 on craftpoker.com.  If that sounds confusing,
just ask me about it and I'll do a better job explaining.  My nickname
is `deadhead`.

### Fun Money only partially implemented

Starting April 12th, mb2 internally keeps track of Fun Money that is
used for tournament buy-ins and payouts as well as for ring game
participation.  The core of this functionality is implemented and
deployed, but currently there's almost no exposure through the UI.

When [ring games are
implemented](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues/88), Fun Money will
be documented and exposed and everyone's bankrolls will be reset.  In
the meantime, just ignore the amount "won" at the end of a tournament.

## Starting Pen Example

If you want to play a TESLA tournament at ten times the speed it was played
at BARGE in 2019, you'd use these commands in the pen/lobby.  You won't,
however, be allowed to start until there are at least two players.  If you
want to see it running, just use two tabs and create two players.

```
tournament tesla
speed 10
join
start
```

## Already knows many poker variants

I'd like mb2 to be able to deal close analogs to all the [BARGE 2019
tournaments](https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/7fa840da/files/uploaded/2019_BARGE_structures%20v2.pdf) as well as the [EMBARGO 2020 tournaments](https://www.barge.org/schedule1).

Albeit with a few nits, mb2 already deals all the games in the [BARGE
2019 Rule Book](http://www.ceemeck.org/BARGERuleBook2019/).

`game`
without an argument lists the games that are at available:

```
Games: ace_to_five_3d, action_razz, archie, badacey, badeucy, badugi, big_o, binglaha, ca_lowball, chowaha,
chowaha_four_8, courchevel, crazy_pine_8, deuce_to_seven, deuce_to_seven_3d, dramaha, dramaha_3d, duck_flush,
five_card_draw, five_card_stud, hold_em, hold_em_8, hold_em_short, irish, korean, lazy_pine, lazy_pine_8,
london_lowball, miss_8, miss_razz, miss_stud, murder, oklahoma, omaha, omaha_8, omaha_short, omaha_two_or_five_8,
razz, razz_deuce_to_seven, razzdugi, scrotum, stud, stud_8, stud_high_low
```
### Action Razz

The only game in that list that is not _yet_ in the BARGE Rulebook is
Action Razz, which is just like
[Razz](http://www.ceemeck.org/BARGERuleBook2019/WSOPgames.html#razz),
except any hand made by a player who has a face card will beat any
hand made by a player without a face card.  The face card does not
need to be in the made hand, so A2345 where at least one of the two
remaining cards is a Jack, Queen or King is the nuts, and even the
incredibly unlikely seven cards of KKKKQQQ beats A234567, because the
former has a face card and the latter doesn't.

A couple of the games that are available have missing functionality
(e.g., mb2 doesn't yet enforce the "sevens rule" in California
Lowball). Known deficiencies show up on the [issues
page](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/issues).


## Pre-built Tournament Structures

All of the [EMBARGO 2020 tournament structures](https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/7fa840da/files/uploaded/2020%20EMBARGO%20Structures.pdf) and all but three of the
[BARGE 2019 tournament structures](https://irp-cdn.multiscreensite.com/7fa840da/files/uploaded/2019_BARGE_structures%20v2.pdf) are implemented.  The three that
aren't require some additional functionality.

`tournament` without an argument lists the tournament structures that
are available.

```
Tournaments: action_razz, barge_nlhe, bourbon, cab, chowaha, crazy_irish, easter, f_cancer, friend, hoe, hoser, irish,
jof_short_nlo, korean, limit_6, limit_he_win_the_button, merlot, monte, oklahoma, pl_horse, plo, razz, sam,
six_handed_nlhe, so_mixed_hold_em, tesla, toc, triple_action_stud
```
### Mixes of Games

A few of the tournaments listed above are particular to mb2 and have not been spread live as far as I know. The first was CAB, which is Chowaha, Action Razz and Binglaha.  All three of those games were created by BARGErs, so I created CAB to honor them.

CAB begat MERLOT (Murder, crazy pineapple/Eight, Razzdugi, Lazy pineapple/eight, Oklahoma, Two or five omaha/eight), thus allowing some of the more obscure games in the BARGE Rulebook to be played in a tournament structure.

Not everyone likes MERLOT, so on Sunday April 5th, BOURBON (Badugi,
Omaha high, dUckflush, Razz, Badacey, Omaha/8, NL 2-7 Lowball) was
introduced as an homage to a particular BARGER's Sunday after BARGE
parties.

Crazy Irish: limit Crazy Pineapple/eight & pot-limit Irish

FRIEND: Five card stud, Razz deuce to seven, Irish, hold 'em/Eight,
No-limit deuce to seven, Dramaha

HOSER: Hold'em, Omaha/eight, Stud, stud/Eight, action Razz

SAM: Scrotum, Action razz, Murder

EASTER: stud/Eight, Archie, Stud, 2-7 Triple draw, Stud Hi/Lo Regular (no qualifier), Razz 

Triple Action Stud: Stud, Action Razz, Stud/Eight

MONTE was the mix tournament played when BARGE was temporarily brought to Washington for [Monte](https://www.barge.org/in-memoriam): pl oMaha8, limit big O, Nlhe, limit Tripledraw, limit omaha Eight

jadc_234: Hold'em, Crazy Pineapple/eight, Omaha/eight

### Single Game

Action Razz

Binglaha

Razz

plhe_wtb_lammers: Pot-Limit Hold'em, Win-the-Button, using lammers

big_o_lammers: Big O, using lammers

big_o_no_lammers: Big O, no lamers

dramaha_3d: Triple Draw Dramaha

pl_big_o_wtb_lammers: Pot-Limit Big O, Win-the-Button, using lammers

## Lammers

Some of the tournament structures (typically only big-bet) include lammers
in addition to starting chips.  Each lammer is worth a fixed amount and
can be used in three different ways:

### Manual Redemption

The redeem command (requires use of the command text box) takes a
single numeric argument that specifies how many lammers you wish to
redeem (e.g., `redeem 2`).

If you are in a hand, the redemption will happen at the end of that
hand.  If you have a redemption scheduled for the end of the hand and
you change your mind you can use `redeem 0`.

If you're not in a hand, the redemption will happen immediately and can
not be reverted.

### Resurrection

If you bust and you have one or more lammers left, exactly one lammer
will be cashed in and you'll be back in the game with the amount of
chips that lammer is worth.

### Forced Redemption

Typically there's a final level where lammers are allowed and if you
finish that level, all lammers you have are redeemed for you (and all
your opponents) automatically.

## Commands

"Soon", mb2 will have sign-up lists for tournaments and ring
games, but now there's a single starting pen that is used just for
testing.  There are commands you use to set up what game/tournament is
to be started next and then there are commands that are used while
you're playing.  Multiple games and tournaments can run simultaneously.

### Starting Pen Commands

The pen commands are:
```
help
status
join
quit
game
tournament
speed factor
secs-to-act seconds
timeout-secs seconds
start
```

Vacation is a state you can be on where you will check whenever
possible but fold to any action. You can voluntarily put yourself on
vacation with `vacation` and you can take yourself off vacation with
`back`, although any command will take you off vacation.

`game` and `tournament` will list the choices you can have for
games and tournaments.

With `game` you can supply an additional argument to specify which
game, e.g., `game holdem`. If you do that, you'll get the default
betting structure for that game (no-limit for Hold'em).  If you want
to specify the betting structure, you can add `potlimit`, `nolimit` or
two integers representing the small-bet and the big-bet in a split
limit (also known as fixed limit) structure.

```
game holdem 5 10
Game changed to 5 10 Hold 'em by deadhead
```
There are no commands to change the size of the blinds.  The small
blind will be one half of the small bet and the big blind will be the
same size as the small bet.  There are no commands to change the
number of starting chips. You'll get 15,000.

By default, when it's your time to act, you get 30 seconds before
you're put on vacation. If you use the `time` command, by default you
get an additional 60 seconds.  Those two values can be changed in the
starting pen (but can not be changed once the tournament has started)
by the `secs-to-act` and the `timeout-secs` commands, respectively.
Both of those commands take a single positive integer argument
specifying how many seconds.

If you want to try the TESLA structure, you'd use `tournament tesla`
TESLA uses 20 minute rounds.  If you'd like to use 2 minute rounds, use
`speed 10` to play the tournament ten times faster (i.e. the duration
is one tenth normal).

### In Game Commands

I will be adding UI elements for everything mentioned here, but until
those UI elements appear, you have to type your commands in the
command box.

When you're in a game, the long versions (there are one letter
abbreviations for all of the common ones) of the commands that are not
available via UI elements are:

```
status
cards
quit
vacation
back
time
muck
reveal
conceal
default reveal
default conceal
discard cards
discard none
undo [action | reveal | discard]
rebuy
rebuy_on_bust
done_on_bust
redeem n_lammers_to_redeem
```
These commands can also be typed in, although there are proof-of-concept check and text boxes that provide the same functionality:

```
fold
check
jam
make amount
call [amount]
bet [amount | pot | half]
raise [amount | pot | half]
```

#### Fold

If you you check the `Fold` check-box, when it's your turn to act, you
will fold, even if it's checked toy you.

#### Check

If you check the `Check` check-box, when it's your turn to act, you will
check if there's no action to you. If there is action, you will have to
choose a different option.

#### Call

If you check the `Call` check-box at the top of the `Call` column, you will
call _any_ action to you, whether it's a bet, raise, re-raise, etc.

If you put a number inside the text-box at the bottom of the `Call` column,
you will call any action up to and including that number of chips.  If the
action to you is more than that number, you will have to choose a different
option.

#### Bet

Betting is the initiation of action, all four options in the `Bet` column
behave the same way in that when it's your turn to act, if there's already
a bet to you, none of the `Bet` options will be exercised, instead you'll
have to choose a different option.  This can be handy if you want to make
a bet, but only if you're first to act.

The other way in which all four options are similar is that what you are
specifying is the maximum you'd like to bet, but if there's a restriction
that prevents you from betting that much, you'll bet the maximum you're
allowed to bet.  The two restrictions are your chip count and whatever
type of limit you're using (e.g., pot-limit).  If, for example, you
click on the `Pot` check-box, and there's 600 in the pot, but you only have
500, if it gets to you and there's no bet, you will bet 500 and go all-in.

The distinction between between the four entries in the `Bet` column is
the top-most one will try to have you bet the minimum.  The one below
that that, labeled `Pot` will try to have you bet the amount currently
in the pot.  `Half` will try half the pot amount.  If you place a number
in the text-box at the bottom of the `Bet` column, you will try to bet
that amount, subject to the caveat in the previous paragraph.

#### Raise

Raise behaves almost like Bet. The big distinction is that Raise will take
effect _whether or not_ you have action to you.  So if you click the top-most
check-box in the `Raise` column, when it's your turn to act, you will either
bet the minimum if there's no action to you, or raise the minimum if there
is already a bet, raise or re-raise to you.

#### Make

If you use `raise 2000` as an advanced action, you will bet or raise
2000 (if that's an acceptable raise) when it is your turn to ask, so
if it's checked to you, you'll make it 2000, but if someone bets 1,000
and then someone else raises 2,000, then you'll raise 2,000 and the
total bet will be 5,000.  If your desire is to raise however much is
required to make the total bet 2,000, you can uses `make 2000`.

Just like Bet and Raise, if you try to make the action a value that is
higher than you're allowed to bet or raise, you'll bet the maximum
you're allowed to bet or raise.  So, if there's 500 in the pot and
you're playing pot-limit and you choose "make 2000", you will bet 500
(assuming you have 500 or more in chips), since that's the max you're
allowed to bet.

#### Jam

Jam simply tries to bet the maximum you're allowed to bet.  In a
no-limit game, you get all your chips in.  In a pot-limit game, you
get as many as your chips are in, but limited by the size of the pot,
etc.

### Commands that currently require use of the command box


Use `time` (or its abbreviation `t`) if you need more time to think.
You'll get an extra minute.  There is currently no limit to how often
you can use the time command.

#### What to reveal at showdown

By default, you will only show your cards at the showdown if you have
to.  If there are no all-ins and someone else shows first and you're
beat, you won't be required to show your cards.  You can change that
default by using `default reveal` in which case any time you make it
to the showdown you'll reveal your cards (which might be helpful if
you're teaching someone the game).  If you want your default to be
back to what it started at `default conceal` will take it back.

You can override your default revelation strategy for the current
hand, by using `reveal` or `conceal`.  That's a one-time change
and after the showdown your default will stay what it was before that
override.  You can also use `muck` which will cause you to throw
away your hand, _even if it's a winner_.

#### Discards, drawing and undoing

You can use `discard ac 2d` tell mb2 that when it's your turn to
discard and draw new cards you want to discard your ace of clubs and
your two of diamonds or `discard none` to stand pat.

If you type an action command before it is your time to act, that
command will be remembered and used instantly when it is your time to
act.  If you realize you don't want that command to be applied, you
can use `undo` to clear all your advance commands or more narrowly
`undo action`, `undo reveal` or `undo discard` to just undo that
aspect of your advance requests.

#### Rebuy Tournaments

If a tournament is a rebuy tournament, mb2 will assume you want to rebuy
each time you bust. If that's not the case, use the `done_on_bust` command
when you want your next bust to be permanent.  If you change your mind, you
can use `rebuy_on_bust` to tell the tournament that when you bust you want
to rebuy, but you must do that before you bust.

When you are playing in a rebuy tournament you can use the `rebuy`
command to ask for chips during the rebuy period.  If you are below
the starting stack size and out of the hand, you'll get them
immediately. If you're in the hand, your request will be remembered at
the end of the hand and if you're below the starting stack size,
you'll get your additional chips before the next hand is dealt.

## Abbreviations

Instead of typing the entire command, you can usually abbreviate:

|Abbreviation|Command|
|------------|-------|
|b|back|
|c|call|
|d|discard|
|f|fold|
|h|help|
|j|jam|
|k|check|
|m|make|
|r|raise|
|s|status|
|t|time|
|v|vacation|
|q|quit|
|ca|cards|
|ck|check|
|de|default|
|hi|conceal|
|mu|muck|
|rb|rebuy|
|re|reveal|
|rob|rebuy_on_bust|
|dob|done_on_bust|
|pat|discard none|
|pot|raise pot|
|half|raise half|

## Play-testing

With a lot of bored people stuck at home, I'm now organizing games
at 5pm Pacific time every day. Currently we have about a half dozen
core players, but new people drop in almost every day and this site
is still _largely_ flying under the radar.

I'm working toward [unsupervised
play-testing](https://github.com/ctm/mb2-doc/milestone/1), but I've
been doing a ton of
[yak-shaving](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/15511/yak-shaving).

If you're curious, show up a ten or fifteen minutes before the start
of the game (5pm Pacific is 6pm Mountain, 7pm Central and 8pm
Eastern).  Someone will help you out.  At the top of the hour (unless
there are stragglers, but please don't be a straggler), *something*
will start.  Once you know your way around the software, please help
out others.  I expect exponential growth, "soon".

## Computer Languages, Frameworks and Libraries

I've written mb2 almost entirely in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), using
[actix-web](https://actix.rs/), [yew](https://yew.rs/docs/),
[diesel](http://diesel.rs) and
[rust-argon2](https://github.com/sru-systems/rust-argon2).  The
exception is that the web client also uses
[UIKit](https://getuikit.com/).  Right now we're not doing much with
UIKit, but that will change, "soon".

I get substantial benefits by developing both the back-end and
front-end in Rust.  Unfortunately, most of the cool functionality I
have in mind is temporarily on hold while I spend a little time
setting up the company that will monetize mb2 and getting investment
and a front-end person.

## Micro Pitch

To be the online poker equivalent of craft beer: fun for everyone,
including the enthusiasts.

### Origin Story

Over twenty years ago, I wrote multibot, which was the first software
to deal multi-table tournaments on the internet.  I did so for two
reasons, I wanted to play multi-table tournaments on the internet and
I wanted to improve my knowledge of Objective-C.  I have written mb2
for two reasons: to make money by degamifying gaming and to improve my
knowledge of Rust.  I've already succeeded in the latter (although I
have a lot more to learn about Rust).
