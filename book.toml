# We ignore all warnings because there's no way (yet?) to selectively
# allow violations.  The absolute path warning is for when people view
# the output from a filesystem, and it makes re-ordering of sections
# even more tedious.  I could, however, life with that, but we also
# have some generated license text that cause the following to happen,
# and ignoring warnings gets rid of that chirpage, too.
#
#     ┌─ third-party-licenses.md:337:18

#337 │ Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]
#    │                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Did you forget to define a URL for `name of copyright owner`?
#
# I'll probably turn warnings on and fix the absolute path ones after
# I've done a little planned restructuring, but without a way to quiet
# the license complaints I'll continue to ignore warnings.
